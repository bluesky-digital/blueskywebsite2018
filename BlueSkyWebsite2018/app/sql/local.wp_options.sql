alive, and working on some things that we&#8217;ve been keeping under wraps for a better part of the year.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Understand, in the beginning, after Simple Options,  Options Framework,  NHP,  SMOF and Redux 2.0 all came together to make Redux 3.0, it rocked the developer community.  All these fine frameworks and their authors coming together for one super project that eventually became the #1 options framework for WordPress theme and plugin developers.  As time marched on, many of our core developers moved onto other projects, or away from WordPress completely.  Many other option frameworks still available have either been abandoned or &#8211; not to put too fine a point on it &#8211; don&#8217;t do nearly half of what Redux in is current incarnation does.  Today, The Redux Framework project is just <a href=\"https://github.com/dovy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dovy</a>, and myself (<a href=\"https://github.com/kprovance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kev</a>).  We&#8217;ve not given up or walked away from this amazing project.  The issue is, WordPress tools designed specifically for developers, versus WordPress users/consumers are not exactly the income providers that tools such as <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WooCommerce</a>, <a href=\"http://bbpress.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bbPress</a>, <a href=\"http://jetpack.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">JetPack</a> are.  Dovy and I were unable to work on Redux full time for the last few years, which meant divided time between the Redux project we love so much &#8211; the one in which we still give our blood, sweat, and tears &#8211; and those <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=4&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiO1bXjttPWAhVn9IMKHcnxC18QFgg5MAM&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fthestir.cafemom.com%2Fhome_garden%2F182312%2F10_pesky_jobs_women_love&amp;usg=AOvVaw0CPB0z1_qQGms7nWSBS1yq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pesky real jobs</a>.  Oh, and sometimes our families enjoy seeing us as well, from time to time.  <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"🙂\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is the big reason why we&#8217;ve not made our presence abundantly front and center for a few years now.  We&#8217;re still fixing issues that come up in the Redux core.  We&#8217;re still answering the issue tracker in what we believe is still a timely fashion.  We&#8217;re still doing everything we need to do to keep Redux alive and healthy.  Dovy and I had a conversation last year about what the future of Redux should be, and where we should go with it.  Much of the code base that is the Redux 3.x core is still a mish-mash of all those previously aforementioned combined frameworks.  Over the years, I&#8217;ve rewritten sections of it here and there, either through bug reports, or by discovering outdated code to keep up with WordPress updates, or in some cases code that simply was not optimized.  Plus, when security issues come up from our community, we address those immediately.  It&#8217;s the commitment we still make to be the the most trusted and secure options framework available.  The discussion we had revolved around breaking up that main framework.php &#8211; which was close to 4000 lines &#8211; into separate components and rewriting our main JavaScript file to support the opt_name argument, which would improve upon many features and provide for new ones we could not implement without those improvements.  The problem was&#8230;time.  Specifically, lack thereof.  Neither one of us had it to give.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>That changed for me earlier this year (2017, for when this post becomes dated).  I found myself without various commitments that occupied most of my time.  All of a sudden, I had more time than I knew what to do with.  So I sat down and began to implement all the ideas Dovy and I discussed.  That huge framework.php now contains a mere 314 lines, with everything else broken up and put into classes, which an <a href=\"http://php.net/manual/en/function.spl-autoload-register.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">autoloader</a> now handles.  Additionally, the classes (core and fields) now use <a href=\"http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.inheritance.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Object Inheritance</a> which seems to have sped thing up a bit.  Somewhere in there I rewrote the main JavaScript file as well to support the opt_name argument.  This will provide a number of benefits.  The biggest will be the forthcoming Advanced Customizer feature of Redux Pro.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Oops, Redux&#8230;what?  Pro&#8230;what?  Did I just spoil something?  Hmmm&#8230;maybe I did.  Keep reading&#8230;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Anyways, a few other benefits of the opt_name implementation of our core JavaScript will also be seen by Metabox users, specifically where there are multiple metaboxes on the same page with different Redux instances (which means, two different projects using Redux appearing on the same page).  The Redux &#8216;required&#8217; feature would only work for one, and not the other.  There are also some benefits for validation.  For example, when using validation on certain fields where information needed to be changed or corrected, those changes would not be seen until after the page was refreshed and not directly after an AJAX based save.  Little things such as this, that folks have been wanting for years will now be possible.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Oh, and just you wait and see what Dovy did for the typography field.  Automatic Google Font updates WITHOUT the need for a Google API key.  Yeah, you heard that right.  Redux now handles it all for you, minus all the annoying permissions issues that used to plague the weekly update feature, to the point where we had to shut it down.  It&#8217;s crazy amazing how it works.  It&#8217;s something you just gotta see for yourself.  Dovy did a kick ass job on it.  Personally, I think it should be the sole reason to upgrade.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So, after all this work, it was clear that bumping Redux 3 a minor version number would not cut it.  This project was now Redux 4.0, and work for it has gone on all summer long.  See?  We&#8217;ve been busy!  Looks (or lack thereof) can be deceiving!  I also made the command decision to update the look of the option panel interface to better match WordPress itself, so the option panel inherits the selected WordPress theme color (using a system close to the one WordPress uses).  Plus, we&#8217;ve been laying the groundwork for Redux Pro compatibility, which version 3 will not have.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Oh, rats&#8230;did I tease that Pro thing again?  Ah, well.  Once again, keep reading.  I want to get the importanct stuff out first, which brings me to backward compatibility.  That is, when version 4 rolls out, it can (and will) replace 3 with no breakage.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Dovy and I come from a school of developers who believe backward compatibility should always be maintained, or that every possible and conceivable effort should be given to the subject (pay attention WooCommerce).  So far, I think we&#8217;ve been pretty good about, being as obsessive about it as we are.  Great lengths have gone into Redux 4.0 to maintain this compatibility, even with all the code changes made.  More than a few <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shim_(computing)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">shims</a> were used to keep our promise to do everything possible to maintain backward compatibility.  This bring me to point of this entire post.  We don&#8217;t want to simply roll out Redux 4.0 without giving it a good shakedown.  We need some other &#8211; and preferably hardcore &#8211; Redux users to load up version 4.0 and verify exactly how seamless the upgrade is.  If there are things we missed, we want to catch them now (you know, instead of potentially breaking over a million sites).  We would prefer to begin with a private beta, a small group of Redux users who are familiar with the project.  We have a private Github repo set up for this.  After a short interval, the Redux 4.0 core will be added via a development/beta branch to the public Github repo for anyone to download and test.  It won&#8217;t replace the 3.x version until we are reasonably sure everything is where it should be.  And then, when we&#8217;re ready, we&#8217;ll push Redux 4.0 for public consumption.  The skies will light up!  Angels will sing!  World peace will fall into place!  Okay, well, maybe not all those things, especially that last one.  It&#8217;ll be a good thing, is my point in chief!  it allows us to move forward with the Redux Framework Project in ways we&#8217;ve only dreamed of doing for years now, which always mean more benefits for our users, and in turn, their users.  Win/win/win.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you are interested in participating in our limited, private beta, fill out the form below.  You will need a Github account to receive an invitation to our private repo.  We&#8217;d also appreciate it if you&#8217;d let us know the project in which Redux is used.  If accepted, additional details will be provided in the email we&#8217;ll be sending out.  Alternatively, If you&#8217;d rather wait for the public beta, we can respect that too.  We&#8217;ll be making another blog post when that happens, detailing all the new features, and things we&#8217;d like checked, areas of focus, etc.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<form

the midnight hour.  It&#8217;s a premium project that will further enhance the Redux Core, similar to what our extensions library does.  After several at-length discussions we&#8217;ve had about the project, we&#8217;ve decided the Advanced Customizer will be part of it, as well as a reworking version of Custom Fonts.  Pro will also include Ad Remover.  it also won&#8217;t be targeted specifically to developers, but also users as well as the project progresses.  There will be some new fields, some major enhancements to existing fields.  We&#8217;ve basically decided all new features and efforts for Redux Framework will be dedicated to the Pro version.  We did promise a long time ago the Redux core would be free, and remain that way and we don&#8217;t want to break that promise while me continue to make efforts to further fund the Redux Framework Project into the future.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s all I&#8217;m giving away right now.  <img

Honestly, we didn&#8217;t do anything horrible, we simply used direct functions rather than letting WordPress run the same functions. So, we decided to make the plunge. We shifted all file input/output to the WP Filesystem and made the changes to our Redux_Filesystem proxy class to handle our problem cases. We also removed a few URLs here, and some function names there.</p>\n<p>We also embedded some really useful custom Theme-Check checks to further assist developers in submitting their themes to marketplaces. We want you &#8211; as developers &#8211; to know exactly what you need to do to comply. We also added a custom WP.org check, to further help WP.org theme developers.</p>\n<p>Our next step is to add proper escaping to our field HTML output. Though Redux already escapes properly &#8211; since we use the WordPress settings API &#8211; we wanted to ensure you don&#8217;t have to tell your reviewers anything. We don&#8217;t want our code to be the cause of your work being flagged by marketplace reviewers. If we already escape something, we&#8217;ll add an inline comment so reviewers know what we are doing.</p>\n<p>In the end, we seek to comply. We want to ensure Redux is for for the masses and ready for any marketplace (no matter how specific the rules may be).</p>\n<h3>We Need Your Help!</h3>\n<p>Please test the <a href=\"http://github.com/ReduxFramework/redux-framework\" target=\"_blank\">development build</a> of Redux Framework in your own theme. Try out Theme-Check, and make sure we didn’t break anything. The sooner we have more eyes on these improvements, the sooner we’ll be able to make an official release, and the sooner we can push down some of our customizer fixes.   <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f609.png\" alt=\"😉\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></p>\n<p>As always, a special thank you our developers.

The uploads directory should be used strictly for media files and downloads and other things uploaded through the various wp_upload functions.” <a href=\"http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/124900/using-wp-filesystem-in-plugins\" target=\"_blank\">http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/124900/using-wp-filesystem-in-plugins</a></p>\n<p>Believing his advice to be sound, we followed his suggestion. It caused more misery to devs than not. The lingering issue is simple, too many users install WordPress incorrectly. Often the ONLY directory that is writable is <code>/uploads/</code>. Combined that with the file owner of WordPress and the theme/plugin directories often being different, and the 3.3.0 changes have been a disaster in the making.</p>\n<p>As the Redux 3.3.0 code base spread out to our devs, and consequently their users, we received TONS of issues. We’ve worked to resolve each of them, but the fact remains that Otto&#8217;s advice is flawed, and users don’t know how to fix the problems is causes.</p>\n<p>We implemented this great new filesystem code believing it was the correct way to handle local storage, but it will never be used again. We’re writing to our proprietary directory the uploads directory from here on out.</p>\n<p>If anyone wishes to contribute code that works with Otto&#8217;s model, that actually works we would consider switching back.

There are dozens upon dozens of them! When devs add multiple Typography fields in their panel, the user experience (load time) becomes quite poor. We&#8217;re pleased to say this issue has been solved with this release. Thanks to the efforts of our main man Kevin, the typography field has be reworked to be much more efficient.</p>\n<p>In addition, we&#8217;ve found a many bugs, fixed some core design issues, added feature requested, and taken Redux to yet another level of stability, all while improving the overall feature set.</p>\n<p>To tie into all these improvements &#8211; and if you didn&#8217;t already know &#8211; the Redux Builder now gives you the option of creating custom builds of Redux with only the fields you specify! The building process has become much more modular, allowing us to providing these great new tools to you so you may lower the footprint of your embedded Redux. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f609.png\" alt=\"😉\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></p>\n<p>As it currently stands, Redux 3.3.0 is the MOST STABLE version of Redux ever. The issues reported to us have become very, very basic. More often than not, we see more feature requests than bugs.</p>\n<p>Now is the time to upgrade Redux Framework your themes. Your users will thank you.

class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You know you’ve hit a home run when your business&#8217;s activity doubles within two months and support issues are reduce by nearly 1/3.  That’s what has happened with Redux since we launched the <a title=\"Redux Generator\" href=\"http://build.reduxframework.com\" target=\"_blank\">Redux Builder</a>.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In early March, I conceived the idea to design a site that would auto-generate a Redux<br />\nbuild.  Actually, I wanted to build a fully-fledged panel builder like Option Tree, but with the sheer amount of options available with Redux, the time required would be intense&#8230;and then some.  Instead, I considered building a boilerplate generator for themes.  And what better theme than the ever powerful <a title=\"_s\" href=\"http://underscores.me\" target=\"_blank\">_s</a> by <a title=\"Automattic\" href=\"http://automattic.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Automattic</a>?  I found their generator code and went to town, including a TGM integration, and a slew of Redux arguments.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Today, I am extremely pleased to announce we took the project it a step further.  We organized the arguments, gave descriptions, and links for each to our docs site.  We also made it so one could easily export to an admin folder instead of a theme.  This comes in handy for use in existing products and/or plugins.  Lastly, we&#8217;ve now made every Redux field completely independent.  As a result, you can generate a custom build of Redux Framework with your export!</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"> Yes, you read that correctly!  You can make a custom Redux Framework build!  Since one of the biggest complaints about Redux has been its size, weighing in at 6mb for all (34+) fields, the Framework tends to be quite heavy.  Now, that&#8217;s a thing of the past.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">We’re really excited about the new version of the Redux Builder.  Major props to team member @kprovance for making Redux fields completely modular.</p>\n<p>If you haven’t tried the builder, you SHOULD.  It’s free.  It will save you time.  Oh, and it’s so very choice.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: center\"><a title=\"Redux Generator\" href=\"http://build.reduxframework.com\" target=\"_blank\">http://build.reduxframework.com</a></h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Just a gentle reminder, Redux lives by donations and our extensions.  So if you like the generator, please consider donating a small amount to the project.  You support us, and we&#8217;ll keep making cool things.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"https://reduxframework.com/2014/05/redux-builder/feed/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2:\"20\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:5:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:27:\"February

of us at Team Redux would like to extend our sincerest thanks to our users for making this last webinar an unprecedented success! As we began the process of writing out the basic structure for the webinar, we had no idea what we were in for. We didn&#8217;t know how many people would show up or even if our users wanted to hear what we had to say. Thankfully, not only did a shocking number of people show up, but the webinar lasted an incredible two full hours!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Beyond the knowledge we hoped to impart to our users, we learned a very important lesson through the webinar as well. We learned that our users <em>want</em> to communicate with us, above and beyond the communication made possible by our Github issue tracker. As such, we have made a decision. Going forward, we will be holding a monthly webinar to give you a view into our world, and us a view into yours! Beyond that, we will be making steps towards a more active blog, and we&#8217;ve got a few other surprises in store for you as well!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Not everyone managed to make it to the webinar&#8230; but that&#8217;s alright, we still love you! Want to see what you&#8217;ve missed? Great! We&#8217;d love to show you! As such, we&#8217;ve made the entire webinar available on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymMpeBaaLXI\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube</a>! Want a copy of the presentation itself?

The Redux Team is proud to welcome Syamil MJ (<a href=\"http://github.com/syamilmj\">@syamilmj</a>), creator of <a href=\"https://github.com/syamilmj/Options-Framework\">SMOF</a> to our family.  We can’t wait to see what he brings to the table.  There’s no denying the fantastic work he’s done with <a href=\"https://github.com/syamilmj/Options-Framework\">SMOF</a>.  Historically, <a href=\"https://github.com/syamilmj/Options-Framework\">SMOF</a> has been the foundation for countless themes on ThemeForest and across the net, so we can’t wait to see what Syamil will bring to the table.  Welcome to the family <a href=\"http://github.com/syamilmj\">Syamil</a>!</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://github.com/syamilmj/Options-Framework\">Slightly Modified Options Framework (SMOF)</a> History</h3>\n<p>On September 29th, 2011, Syamil introduced <a href=\"https://github.com/syamilmj/Options-Framework\">SMOF</a> to the world . Based heavily on <a href=\"https://github.com/helgatheviking\">helgatheviking</a>’s KIA Options Framework, (which was forked from the original <a href=\"https://github.com/devinsays/options-framework-plugin\">Options Framework</a>) by <a href=\"https://github.com/devinsays/\">Devin Price</a>, many additional ideals and asthetic improvement came from <a href=\"https://github.com/valendesigns/option-tree\">Options Tree</a>.  <a href=\"https://github.com/syamilmj/Options-Framework\">SMOF’s</a> goal became one of offering a modern-looking, feature-rich options framework many theme developers adopted.   It became a solid example of what quality work does for the community.</p>\n<h3>Dovy Paukstys: I Never Dared to Dream…</h3>\n<p>In July of 2013, I began contributing frequently to the <a href=\"https://github.com/syamilmj/Options-Framework\">SMOF</a> project.  I fixed bugs, changed things around, and created a fully integrated customizer experience.  However, I soon discovered I needed more.  Not because of <a href=\"http://github.com/syamilmj\">@syamilmj</a>‘s work, but because of the foundation in which <a href=\"https://github.com/syamilmj/Options-Framework\">SMOF</a> derived from.  I also discovered  <a href=\"https://github.com/leemason/NHP-Theme-Options-Framework\">NHP</a>.  I loved <a href=\"https://github.com/leemason/NHP-Theme-Options-Framework\">NHP</a>’s code, but it wasn’t as visually appealing as <a href=\"https://github.com/syamilmj/Options-Framework\">SMOF</a>, by any means.  I created a fork of both, which I called <a href=\"https://github.com/SimpleRain/SimpleOptions\">SimpleOptions</a>.  After 3 months or so of work to merge the two frameworks, <a href=\"https://github.com/ghost1227\">@ghost1227</a> approached me with an offer I couldn’t refuse.  We realized it would benefit the community immensly if we joined forces instead of working apart.  Thus, Redux Framework 3.0 was born from the code of <a href=\"https://github.com/syamilmj/Options-Framework\">SMOF</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/leemason/NHP-Theme-Options-Framework\">NHP</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/SimpleRain/SimpleOptions\">SimpleOptions</a>.  When I set out to work on <a href=\"https://github.com/SimpleRain/SimpleOptions\">SimpleOptions</a>, and later Redux, I never imagined that both the original creators of <a href=\"https://github.com/leemason/NHP-Theme-Options-Framework\">NHP</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/syamilmj/Options-Framework\">SMOF</a> would join team Redux, birthing one of the most versitile WordPress options framework ever seen.  I am both honored and excited by the possibilities of our colaborated efforts.</p>\n<h2>To all <a href=\"https://github.com/syamilmj/Options-Framework\">SMOF</a> Users</h2>\n<p>Don’t worry, you’re not shut out in the cold!  We want to help you migrate seamlessly from <a href=\"https://github.com/syamilmj/Options-Framework\">SMOF</a> to Redux.  We’re pleased to announce the release of our <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/redux-converter/\">Redux Converter</a> tool, available at: http://wordpress.org/plugins/redux-converter/.   With this tool, you can test Redux immediately, generating a new config file on the fly based on your current SMOF config.  We also automate the data migration on theme activation (or upgrade) for you, providing peace of mind for you and your users.  Give it a try, we promise you’ll not be disappointed!</p>\n<h4>To infinity, and beyond…</h4>\n<p>There are so many amazing features in the works for Redux, and we want you to join us in the experience!  Hold on to your hats ladies and gentlemen, 2014 is going to be an amazing year!</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"https://reduxframework.com/2014/01/smof-merges-with-redux/feed/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}s:27:\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\";a:1:{s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:0:\"\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:3:{s:4:\"href\";s:31:\"http://reduxframework.com/feed/\";s:3:\"rel\";s:4:\"self\";s:4:\"type\";s:19:\"application/rss+xml\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:44:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/syndication/\";a:2:{s:12:\"updatePeriod\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"hourly\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:15:\"updateFrequency\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"1\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";O:42:\"Requests_Utility_CaseInsensitiveDictionary\":1:{s:7:\"\0*\0data\";a:13:{s:6:\"server\";s:12:\"nginx/1.10.3\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Fri, 17 Aug 2018 03:12:08 GMT\";s:12:\"content-type\";s:34:\"application/rss+xml; charset=UTF-8\";s:10:\"set-cookie\";a:2:{i:0;s:44:\"PHPSESSID=bavlri7l821816f81fnfmja9m0; path=/\";i:1;s:38:\"wpfront-notification-bar-landingpage=1\";}s:7:\"expires\";s:29:\"Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT\";s:13:\"cache-control\";s:35:\"no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate\";s:6:\"pragma\";s:8:\"no-cache\";s:13:\"last-modified\";s:29:\"Wed, 04 Jul 2018 07:38:19 GMT\";s:4:\"etag\";s:34:\"\"fb1d6c1c9d36c35d1e4bcc91ce1ebd3b\"\";s:12:\"x-robots-tag\";s:15:\"noindex, follow\";s:4:\"link\";s:63:\"<https://reduxframework.com/wp-json/>; rel=\"https://api.w.org/\"\";s:16:\"content-encoding\";s:4:\"gzip\";s:4:\"vary\";s:15:\"Accept-Encoding\";}}s:5:\"build\";s:14:\"20180816132009\";}","no"),

This is a noteworthy occasion for an open-source project like WordPress and one well worth celebrating. To mark the occasion, <a href=\"https://wp15.wordpress.net/\">WordPress communities across the world gathered</a> for parties and meetups in honor of the milestone.</p>\n\n<p>Altogether, there were 224 events globally, with <a href=\"https://wp15.wordpress.net/about/\">a few more of those still scheduled</a> to take place in some communities — attend one in your area if you can.</p>\n\n<p>If your city doesn’t have a WordPress meetup group, this is a great opportunity to start one!

It is worth noting, however, that WordPress cannot ensure you are compliant — this is still a site owner’s responsibility.</p>\n\n<p>The new privacy tools include a number of features focused on providing privacy and personal data management to all site users — asking commenters for explicit consent to store their details in a cookie, providing site owners with an easy way to publish a Privacy Policy, and providing data export and erasure tools to all site users that can be extended by plugins to allow the handling of data that they introduce.</p>\n\n<p>To find out more about these features and the other updates, read the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/05/17/4-9-6-update-guide/\">4.9.6 update guide</a>. You can also get involved in contributing to this part of WordPress Core by jumping into the #core-privacy channel in the<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\"> Making WordPress Slack group</a>, and following<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\"> the Core team blog</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Updates to the WordPress.org Privacy Policy</h2>\n\n<p>In a similar vein, WordPress.org itself has received <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/privacy/\">an updated Privacy Policy</a> to make clear what is being tracked and how your data is handled. Along with that, a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/privacy/cookies/\">Cookie Policy</a> has also been added to explain just what is collected and stored in your browser when using the site.</p>\n\n<p>These policies cover all sites on the WordPress.org network — including WordPress.org, WordPress.net, WordCamp.org, BuddyPress.org, bbPress.org, and other related domains and subdomains. It’s important to note that this does not mean that anything has changed in terms of data storage; rather that these documents clarify what data is stored and how it is handled.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n<h2>Further Reading:</h2>\n\n<ul>\n	<li>WordCamp US 2018 has <a href=\"https://2018.us.wordcamp.org/2018/05/29/speak-at-wordcamp-us/\">opened up speaker submissions</a> for the December event.</li>\n	<li><a href=\"https://2018.europe.wordcamp.org/2018/05/15/wceu-live-stream-tickets/\">Live stream tickets are now available for WordCamp Europe</a>, happening on June 14-16.</li>\n	<li>Gutenberg, the new editor for WordPress Core, is getting ever closer to the final stages with <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/05/18/whats-new-in-gutenberg-18th-may/\">a major update</a> this month.</li>\n	<li>In preparation for Gutenberg, <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/43309\">significant work has been done</a> to improve WordPress Core’s build process.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>If you have a story we should consider including in the next “Month in WordPress” post, please <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/month-in-wordpress-submissions/\">submit it here</a>.</em></p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"6065\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"\n		\n		\n				\n		\n				\n		\n\n		\n				\n								\n										\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:36:\"WordPress.org Privacy Policy Updates\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2018/05/wordpress-org-privacy-policy-updates/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 25 May 2018 08:06:29 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"General\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"privacy\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=6047\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:325:\"The WordPress.org privacy policy has been updated, hurray!

The Community Team has been hard at work helping communities around the world plan local anniversary parties.</p>\n\n<p>Check <a href=\"https://wp15.wordpress.net/\">the central anniversary website</a> to see if there’s already a party being planned near you. These parties are all organized by local communities — if there’s no local community in your area, you can <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/welcome/#starting-a-new-meetup-com-group\">start one today</a> and host a party yourself.</p>\n\n<h2>Work has Started on a Gutenberg Migration Guide</h2>\n\n<p>With Gutenberg, the upcoming WordPress content editor, in rapid development, a lot of people have been wondering how they will convert their existing plugins to work with the new features. To mitigate the issues here and help people overcome any migration hurdles, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/04/26/your-help-wanted-gutenberg-migration-guide/\">a Gutenberg Migration Guide is underway</a> to assist developers with making their code Gutenberg-compatible.</p>\n\n<p>If you’d like to contribute to this guide, you can review <a href=\"https://github.com/danielbachhuber/gutenberg-migration-guide\">the existing documentation on GitHub</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/danielbachhuber/gutenberg-migration-guide/issues\">open a new issue</a> if you find something to add.</p>\n\n<h2>Theme Review Team Launches Trusted Authors Program</h2>\n\n<p>Reviews of themes submitted to the Theme Directory can take quite a while to complete. In order to combat this issue and to make the theme submission process smoother for everyone, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2018/04/30/trusted-authors-program/\">the Theme Review Team is introducing a Trusted Authors Program</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This program will allow frequent and reliable theme authors to apply for trusted status, allowing them to upload themes more frequently and to have their themes automatically approved. This will allow more high-quality themes to be added to the directory, as well as recognize the hard work that authors put in to build their themes.</p>\n\n<p>If you would like to get involved with reviewing themes, you can read <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/get-involved/become-a-reviewer/\">their getting started guide</a>, follow the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/\">team blog</a> and join the #themereview channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n<h2>Further Reading:</h2>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2018/04/wordpress-4-9-5-security-and-maintenance-release/\">WordPress 4.9.5 was released</a> early this month, fixing numerous bugs and potential security issues.

Version 10.5 increased its compatibility with Gutenberg. <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-for-ios-and-gutenberg-dont-get-along\">Earlier this year</a>, Gutenberg and the iOS app didn&#8217;t get along particularly well. </p>\n\n<p>About a month ago in 10.4, an activity log was added that allows users to see a detailed list of activities on their sites. In 10.6, the most recent version, the activity log is now available for free WordPress.com sites and those connected with Jetpack.</p>\n\n<img />WordPress for iOS Activity Log\n\n<p>As you can see in the screenshot above, comment activity, post and page activity, and generally all site activity shows up in the log. </p>\n\n<p>Selecting an activity displays detailed information such as who performed the action, their role, IP address, and other information depending on the activity. The log displays the last 20 activities performed on the site.</p>\n\n<p>It&#8217;s unclear exactly what data the activity log monitors, where or if it&#8217;s saved, how it&#8217;s generated, and how users can turn it off. Browsing around the mobile app, I was unable to find a way to disable the activity log.</p>\n\n<h2>The WordPress Mobile Team is Quiet But Busy</h2>\n\n<p>If it weren&#8217;t for the change logs on the iTunes Store, it would be difficult for users to know what&#8217;s going on with the app. The project&#8217;s <a href=\"https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/WordPress-iOS\">GitHub page</a> is buzzing with activity, but more public facing means of communication are not. <br /></p>\n\n<p>The WordPress for iOS app <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wordpressios?lang=en\">Twitter account</a> has been dormant since May. The <a href=\"https://apps.wordpress.com/blog/\">WordPress Mobile apps blog</a> hasn&#8217;t published a new post since 2016 and some of the posts that highlight new features are on the official <a href=\"https://en.blog.wordpress.com/\">WordPress.com blog</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Sure, not every release requires a full-featured post, but the activity log is a feature that I think warrants one. An explanation of why it was created, how it works, and how users not interested in it can disable it. </p>\n\n<p>The WordPress for iOS app is <a href=\"https://apps.wordpress.com/contribute/\">open source</a> and available for free from the <a href=\"https://search.itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZContentLink.woa/wa/link?mt=8&path=apps%2fWordPress\">Apple iTunes App Store</a>. You can also find links to the Android and Desktop apps on the <a href=\"https://apps.wordpress.com/\">WordPress.com Apps site</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>*Update*</h2>\n\n<p>After this article was published, I was given a <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/support/activity-log/\">link to a support document</a> on the Jetpack website that explains the activity log feature in more detail. The document <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/support/activity-log/#data-retention\">links to a list of activities</a> along with their retention periods which vary based on the plan attached to the user&#8217;s WordPress.com account. </p>\n\n<p>Only the most recent 1,000 events are displayed in the log. As noted at the end of the article, once the retention period ends for activity data, it&#8217;s moved to long-term storage where it is retained indefinitely. Data held in long-term storage is removed from the activity log.</p>\n\n<p>According to the document, there is no way to deactivate this feature. <br /></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 16 Aug 2018 22:12:44 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:125:\"WPTavern: WordPress.com Boots Sandy Hook Conspiracy Theory Sites, Bans Malicious Publication of Unauthorized Images of Minors\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=83171\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:135:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-com-boots-sandy-hook-conspiracy-theory-sites-bans-malicious-publication-of-unauthorized-images-of-minors\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13585:\"<p>WordPress.com came under fire this week for hosting a site with conspiracy theories claiming the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting was a hoax. The New York Times published an article titled &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/13/business/media/sandy-hook-conspiracies-leonard-pozner.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">This Company Keeps Lies About Sandy Hook on the Web</a>,&#8221; setting off a hailstorm of angry posts on social media that demanded Automattic take action.</p>\n<p>“Posting conspiracy theories or untrue content is not banned from WordPress.com, and unfortunately this is one of those situations,” Automattic told the New York Times in a statement. “It is a truly awful situation, and we are sympathetic to the Pozner family.”</p>\n<p>Leonard Pozner, father of Sandy Hook Elementary shooting victim Noah Pozner, claims that images of his son were being misused on a WordPress.com-hosted site where the author denied the tragedy and called his son a crisis actor. He filed copyright infringement claims on the images used on the conspiracy site in an attempt to get the content removed.</p>\n<p>Automattic examined the images and determined that there was nothing illegal about their use on the site. The company sent Pozner a reply that said, &#8220;because we believe this to be fair use of the material, we will not be removing it at this time.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In the New York Times article, Automattic admits its insensitivity in handling the situation, apologizing to the family, but said the posts in question &#8220;are not violating any current user guidelines, or copyright law.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;The pain that the family has suffered is very real and if tied to the contents of sites we host, we want to have policies to address that,&#8221; Automattic told the New York Times.</p>\n<h3>WordPress.com Updates it Privacy Policy, Banning Malicious Publication of Unauthorized, Identifying Images of Minors</h3>\n<p>After consulting with the Internet Archive&#8217;s Wayback Machine, it appears WordPress.com has quietly updated its privacy policy, which now includes unauthorized images of minors on the list of things the platform considers private information. The <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180201091159/https://en.support.wordpress.com/private-information/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">previous policy</a> appears below:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-16-at-8.29.14-AM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.support.wordpress.com/private-information/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">updated policy</a> adds &#8220;the malicious publication of unauthorized, identifying images of minors&#8221; to that list.</p>\n<p>Searching Twitter for discussion surrounding Sandy Hook conspiracy sites turns up a slew of tweets calling on people to boycott WordPress.com and other Automattic products. However, there are also responses on the other end of the spectrum, with Sandy Hook conspiracy theorist supporters retweeting a user who claims that WordPress.com has shut down his site.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Minutes ago this morning, I discovered that WordPress has unilaterally and without warning shut down Fellowship of the Minds for alleged violations of \"Terms of Service\". I will explore finding another server for FOTM. Please pray for America.</p>\n<p>&mdash; Eowyn (@DrEowyn) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DrEowyn/status/1029338304376795136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 14, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">WordPress just suspended my interim blog The Fundamental Option as well. That blog has been active for only the past 2 days, so what possible \"terms of service\" could have have violated? It\'s war, folks. America is entering into very dark days. Be prepared.</p>\n<p>&mdash; Eowyn (@DrEowyn) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DrEowyn/status/1029788566459625472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 15, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>The site in question (fellowshipofminds.com) appears to have been removed, along with an interim site the author created following the first suspension. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/memoryholeblog/status/1029415973500137479\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">A number of other related sites</a> have also recently been removed. These events are outlined in <a href=\"http://memoryholeblog.org/2018/08/14/wordpress-automattic-shuts-down-fellowshipoftheminds/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a post on memoryholeblog.org</a>, a site maintained by James F. Tracy, a former professor of journalism and media who became known for his research questioning the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre and Boston Marathon bombing. Tracy&#8217;s blog was also removed from WordPress.com in 2016 for violation of Automattic’s Terms of Service.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-16-at-8.48.40-AM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Automattic did not detail specific infractions in either case of removal. It&#8217;s not clear whether the site referenced in the New York Times article was removed for a new offense or a previous one. The removals seem to have coincided with WordPress.com&#8217;s updated privacy policy, but Automattic&#8217;s PR department has not responded to a request for comment on the matter.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As with Automattic’s treatment of MHB, FOTM’s disappearance strongly suggests how WordPress.com’s policies are being tailored to placate outside parties whose foremost interest is in stifling political speech on potential high crimes, and how in this instance such poorly-founded grounds for censorship have triumphed over free speech,&#8221; Tracy said.</p>\n<p>Historically, Automattic has been a stalwart defender of free speech on the web. It&#8217;s outlined as part of the <a href=\"https://en.support.wordpress.com/user-guidelines/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress.com&#8217;s User Guidelines</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>WordPress.com strongly believes in freedom of speech. We have a vast audience spread across many cultures, countries and backgrounds with varying values and our service is designed to let users freely express any ideas and opinions without us censoring or endorsing them.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It&#8217;s not clear whether Automattic changed its policy in response to this situation or whether this situation revealed holes in it that the company wanted to improve. In either case, the policy change seems to have enabled Automattic to do what outraged onlookers wanted them to do, except outside of the emotional mandate issued by the New York Times.</p>\n<p>Without the new privacy policy in place, removal of a site based on offensive material constitutes censorship. Automattic had already determined that the post using the child&#8217;s image, while distasteful and offensive, was fair use for the material. The image had likely already been used thousands of times by news organizations with a different narrative attached to it that is more in alignment with the majority&#8217;s view of the tragedy.</p>\n<p>As it is a private company, Automattic&#8217;s terms of service do not have to reflect the full freedom of speech allowed by the law. However, the company has always upheld its reputation in the past as an uncompromising defender of its users when presented with requests for censorship.</p>\n<p>In a recent <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180206/10271639166/why-allegedly-defamatory-content-wordpresscom-doesnt-come-down-without-court-order.shtml\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">post on Techdirt</a>, Automattic general counsel Paul Sieminski and Holly Hogan detail how WordPress.com handles its role in managing intermediary liability when the company receives complaints regarding defamatory content:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Making online hosts and other intermediaries like WordPress.com liable for the allegedly defamatory content posted by users is often criticized for burdening hosts and stifling innovation. But intermediary liability isn&#8217;t just bad for online hosts. It&#8217;s also terrible for online speech. The looming possibility of writing a large check incentivizes hosts like Automattic to do one thing when we first receive a complaint about content: Remove it. That decision may legally protect the host, but it doesn&#8217;t protect users or their online speech.</p></blockquote>\n<p>That article explains the level of nuance involved in handling complaints and the costs associated with protecting its users&#8217; freedom of speech. Automattic&#8217;s counsel concludes with an observation that &#8220;leaving such important decisions to the discretion of Internet hosts is misplaced and tilts the balance in favor of silencing often legitimate voices.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>WordPress.com is a Host for Websites, Not a Social Media Silo</h3>\n<p>WordPress.com&#8217;s platform is distinct from social networks in that it is not a social media silo. It acts more as a host and cannot have one-off shutdowns of sites anytime there is a public outcry.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WordPress.com is much closer to being a common carrier than Facebook and other social media,&#8221; Dan Kennedy, associate professor at Northeastern University&#8217;s school of Journalism, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dankennedy_nu/status/1029343514243616769\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> in response to the NYT article. &#8220;That difference really doesn’t get highlighted here.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Self-hosted WordPress (.org) user and data journalist Matt Stiles also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stiles/status/1029220655013609472\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">commented on the distinction</a>, and followed up with me privately, identifying WordPress.com as &#8220;a free-speech sidewalk for the Internet.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;WordPress.com needs to make clear to the public that it&#8217;s a host, not a place that controls &#8212; through algorithms or other curation, and revenue — content,&#8221; Stiles said. &#8220;I am NOT a supporter of sites like this. I just want WordPress to thrive as an open-source tool and as an important paid host for web sites. I&#8217;m also worried about WordPress.com having to make arbitrary decisions about content. It&#8217;s tough to define hate speech. We know it when we see it, but I worry about censorship on private platforms.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Dave Winer also <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2018/08/16/132055.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">commented</a> that the article failed to capture the distinction of WordPress.com as a host for websites:</p>\n<blockquote><p>WordPress.com isn&#8217;t like the others, it isn&#8217;t a silo, so banning him from that service will not necessarily have any affect on the presence of his site. He will be able to export his site, set up his own server, point the DNS entry at that server, and proceed on the open web and it will appear to outside viewers as if nothing happened. This will be the end of the discussion, unless the anti-speech advocates try to exert pressure on the open web. There they will find there is no CEO, no corporate headquarters, no shareholders afraid of losing value, none of the usual pressure points.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This particular situation regarding the Sandy Hook conspiracy site seems to have hit a nerve due to the fact that there are children involved. Despite WordPress.com&#8217;s quick privacy policy change in this instance, Automattic is still a rare outlier among publishing companies when it comes to support of free speech on the web. Media outlets and tech companies are increasingly clamoring for offensive content to be removed, instead of taking a principled stand against censorship.</p>\n<p>Today <a href=\"https://www.poynter.org/news/200-newspapers-will-write-pro-journalism-editorials-will-they-also-listen\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">more than 200 newspapers</a>, including the New York Times, are coordinating to publish editorials calling out President Trump&#8217;s characterization of the press as the &#8220;enemy of the people.&#8221; Corporate-owned news media is ready to decry attacks on free speech, but do they really believe in it when it counts? That freedom isn&#8217;t predicated on whether the speech is true or unoffensive to readers.</p>\n<p>Calling out a free speech platform like WordPress.com, without any distinction for its vital role in enabling journalists across the globe, is a coercive attempt to exact a desired result. What WordPress.com has done is groundbreaking in democratizing publishing and enabling bloggers to break news on their own sites.</p>\n<p>The New York Times raking WordPress.com over the coals for its refusal to censor its users is an egregious double standard. A publication cannot call for free speech for itself while eating up the rights of everyone else they don&#8217;t agree with. Principles aren&#8217;t principles if they only serve you when they are convenient.</p>\n<p>Forcing the censorship of offensive speech may feel like swift justice in the short term, but it weakens the fabric of a free society. Let discerning readers make up their own minds when they come across sites disseminating conspiracy theories.  Although it may be an unpopular stance, the tragic nature of this particular offense cannot bypass the principles that underpin our basic freedoms.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 16 Aug 2018 16:58:35 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 327 – Truth, Misinformation, and Good Ideas\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"https://wptavern.com?p=83205&preview=true&preview_id=83205\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-327-truth-misinformation-and-good-ideas\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2980:\"<p>In this episode, <a href=\"http://jjj.me\">John James Jacoby</a> and I discuss what&#8217;s new in the world of WordPress.

Near the end of the show, we have a thoughtful conversation around misinformation, truth, and the fine line of allowing freedom of speech on private platforms.</p>\n<p>I apologize for the audio quality in this episode. During the Live hangout, there were no issues detected. However, once the video was encoded by YouTube, audio issues were present, the video was choppy, and the length of the show was shortened.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I&#8217;ve been complacent with Google Hangouts&#8217; reliability and have not been recording my audio locally. Beginning next week, Jacoby and I will record our audio locally so if this issue happens again, we&#8217;ll be able to combine the audio tracks.

Jeet, <a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/ill-keep-looking-for-a-cms-unless-i-find-wordpress/\">Saurabh</a>, <a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/wordpress-my-passport-to-open-source/\">Aditya</a>, <a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/growing-wordpress-india/\">Alexander</a>, and <a href=\"https://heropress.com/?s=india\">many others</a> gave deep and meaningful advice on how I, as a white American male, should approach the task I had set before me. This is one of the reasons it makes me so happy when I hear stories of how WordPress changes lives there, especially for women.</p>\n<p>This week&#8217;s HeroPress replay is from Juhi Patel, from Gujarat, in northwestern India.

Not only did she have the courage to move against that belief system, WordPress gave her the tools to practically make it happen, and thereby be an example to other women around her.

This major update also revamps the classic editor&#8217;s meta box for those who do not have the Gutenberg plugin installed.</p>\n<p>In the past, the Yoast SEO meta box was displayed below the post editor. In the Gutenberg UI, the meta box has been redesigned to fit in the sidebar. Those testing Gutenberg will also temporarily find an additional meta box below the post, as the Yoast team has not yet added all optimizations to both yet. In the future, users will have the option to choose between the two.</p>\n<p>The updated design displays individual optimizations in collapsible panels with colored smiley face indicators for feedback at a glance. The snippet preview and social previews feature can still be found in the meta box below the post editor. They will be integrated more tightly into the Gutenberg UI in a future round of updates.</p>\n<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/gutenberg-sidebar-yoast.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a>image credit: <a href=\"https://yoast.com/yoast-seo-8-0-introducing-the-yoast-seo-gutenberg-sidebar-a-revamped-meta-box/\">Yoast SEO</a>\n<p>Yoast SEO 8.0 also brings some of the meta box UI improvements to the one displayed in the classic editor.

The Yoast SEO team is working on using modals to display previews for snippets and social posts from the sidebar so the interface isn&#8217;t split across two meta boxes. Users will eventually have the option to toggle either meta box display option into view, including those who are using the classic editor. The team is also working on allowing users to create blocks with the correct structured data automatically attached for things like books, recipes, products, and other specific content types.</p>\n<p>WordPress.org has a handful of popular SEO plugins and Yoast SEO is currently leading the pack when it comes to integration with the Gutenberg UI. In a recent support <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/gutenberg-12/#post-10379255\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">thread</a>, All in One SEO Pack creator Michael Torbert said his plugin is &#8220;compatible with Gutenberg and will be getting new features to work with it in time.&#8221; Torbert doesn&#8217;t have full <a href=\"https://github.com/semperfiwebdesign/all-in-one-seo-pack/issues/1122\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg integration</a> assigned to a milestone on GitHub yet.</p>\n<p>The SEO Framework, another SEO plugin growing in popularity, appears to be in the same boat if <a href=\"https://github.com/sybrew/the-seo-framework/issues/235\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub activity</a> is any indication.

In addition to the funding, selected companies will be able to take advantage of Awesome Motive&#8217;s media presence, network of business associates, and receive guidance.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;The problem is that the WordPress market is not very well understood by investors,&#8221; Balkhi said. &#8220;And frankly, the majority of WordPress businesses are not large enough to meet their criteria.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;But this doesn’t mean that WordPress businesses don’t have the potential. It’s quite the opposite – they have a lot of potential. There are tons of opportunities to grow in the WordPress ecosystem with the right playbook, and I want to help prove that.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Founders will be given a lot of advice although they won&#8217;t be required to act upon it. Backers of the growth fund will also maintain a hands-off approach, interfering as little as possible with day-to-day operations. </p>\n\n<p>Five companies will be hand-selected to receive funding. To be eligible for investments, WordPress-focused companies must be at least six months old.

Keijonen&#8217;s WordPress.org-hosted themes are active on more than 10,000 websites.</p>\n<p>During the past three years he began taking on more client work, which gave him less time for theme building and maintenance. Last month he accepted a front-end engineer position at 10up that is keeping him busy.</p>\n<p>Fans might remember Keijonen&#8217;s <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/the-mina-olen-free-wordpress-theme-experiment\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mina Olen Free WordPress Theme Experiment</a> when he made the theme available for free on GitHub to see if potential customers would be inspired to purchase after being able to test drive the theme on their own sites. At that time he said he struggled to support his theme shop, because the business aspect of it wasn&#8217;t one of his strengths.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s easy to get lost in all the competition in the WordPress theme industry, especially when major players have more money to drop on advertising and support staff. The days of building a beautiful theme and selling it without any kind of marketing are long gone. Prospective theme developers have to be ready to embrace the challenges of competing in a much wider market in 2018.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Foxland isn’t a gold mine,&#8221; Keijonen said in his announcement. &#8220;Foxland brings about 3,000 to 4,000 Euros per year, which is OK but my goal was 10,000 euros.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Customers appreciated Keijonen&#8217;s attention to detail, accessibility, and performance. Respected WordPress theme author <a href=\"https://tungdo.github.io/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Tung Do</a> said Keijonen&#8217;s themes are &#8220;great examples of best practices.&#8221; Many of them also include support for popular plugins.</p>\n<p>For example, <a href=\"https://foxland.fi/downloads/checathlon/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Checathlon</a>, one of his best works, is active on <a href=\"https://foxland.fi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">foxland.fi</a>. It offers built-in styles for Easy Digital Downloads (including product and account pages), Custom Content Portfolio, and Jetpack (testimonials, portfolio, and email subscription widget).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checathlon.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://foxland.fi/downloads/category/themes/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Foxland collection</a> includes several beautiful minimalist free themes with previously-pro versions that enable additional Customizer settings, page templates, and widgets. All of Keijonen&#8217;s custom <a href=\"https://foxland.fi/downloads/category/plugins/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">plugins</a> (created to accompany the themes) are also available for free.</p>\n<p>The Foxland shop has cancelled all the recurring subscriptions but will continue to support existing purchases up to a year from the purchase date. Keijonen said he will maintain most of the old themes and plugins with small updates coming in the future but plans to deprecate some as well.</p>\n<p>The landscape of WordPress theming is about to change quite a bit when Gutenberg is merged into core.

The service is now widely used by many open source projects. Webpack, one of the first major Open Collective success stories, was able to fund its first full-time developer through the service and is now <a href=\"https://opencollective.com/webpack\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">operating on an estimated annual budget of $331,471</a>. The <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/how-the-san-francisco-wordpress-meetup-is-using-open-collective-to-fund-activities\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">San Francisco WordPress meetup</a> (WPSFO) is one example of a WordPress group that successfully uses the service to <a href=\"https://opencollective.com/wordpress-sf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">receive sponsorships</a> that help cover expenses for events.</p>\n<p>Open Collective has launched a new tool called <a href=\"https://backyourstack.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">BackYourStack</a> that helps people and organizations become aware of projects they use that need funding. The tool scans GitHub accounts (for individuals and organizations) and identifies projects that have already set up accounts on Open Collective. The tool shows all detected dependencies and the repositories where they are used.</p>\n<p>Here are a few sample results you get from scanning the WordPress GitHub account:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-13-at-11.36.42-AM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The results display where project is used, the number of full-time maintainers, progress to reach the next goal, and a few organizations that are already backing the project. Open Collective also allows backers to support multiple dependences in bulk via a lump sum as an alternative to backing each project individually.</p>\n<p>Not every open source project listed on Open Collective will have the need to fund salaries and events, but even a small yearly budget can reduce out-of-pocket costs for open source maintainers for things like hosting and promotional costs.

Yoast SEO 8.0 is coming next week with the first round of compatibility in place.</p>\n<p>&#8220;8.0 is coming on Tuesday with most of it, some bits are relying on the integration of an annotations API in Gutenberg, which is not entirely under our control,&#8221; de Valk said. &#8220;We need that to do markings like we do in the classic editor to highlight where your errors are. Feature complete is quite a while off &#8211; we want to do a LOT. Gutenberg is opening a whole new playing field for us in terms of more in context, actionable feedback.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Future versions of Yoast SEO will offer more features inline, instead of housing them in a single meta box.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We started by breaking down all our features, and seeing where we could integrate them into Gutenberg,&#8221; de Valk said in a <a href=\"https://yoast.com/gutenberg-integration/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> outlining Yoast SEO&#8217;s planned approach back in October 2017. &#8220;We don’t think holding on to a single, massive box below the editor will best serve our customers. We’d much rather integrate right where the action happens, and Gutenberg offers us that chance.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For example, readability analysis can be shown on a per-block basis to provide more fine-grained feedback:</p>\n<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/readability-analysis.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a>image credit: <a href=\"https://yoast.com/gutenberg-integration/\">Yoast SEO</a>\n<p>&#8220;You’ll get actionable feedback in context,&#8221; de Valk said. &#8220;You don’t have to scroll down to a meta box to see the advice and scroll up again to the place where you should implement it. If we give feedback per block, you will get a better understanding of all the factors that influence SEO.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Yoast SEO team has been enthusiastic about what the Gutenberg era will bring to WordPress. In a recent <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jdevalk/status/1026084237508788225\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter thread</a>, de Valk summarized his thoughts on the project and described the direction the Yoast SEO plugin is headed:</p>\n<blockquote><p>[I&#8217;ve] been thinking about Gutenberg more lately, as discussion about it is growing now that it&#8217;s near to WordPress core inclusion. What is most important in what we&#8217;re doing is something I think most people don&#8217;t see yet: The new &#8216;blocks&#8217; that Gutenberg introduces allow us to, much more easily, make content items instead of web pages the smallest particle of the web.</p>\n<p>Questions and answers, how to&#8217;s, recipes, suddenly all of them can much more easily have metadata, and be reused. This is particularly important to SEOs: the search engines, driven by voice search requirements, are searching for answers, more than for &#8216;just&#8217; URLs to send traffic to, and blocks allow us to give them those answers, in a format both they and users can understand. While doing this, it allows us to keep the separation of content and design, something we definitely need to think more about.</p></blockquote>\n<p>With Gutenberg compatibility on its way from widely-used plugins like ACF and Yoast SEO, users can have confidence more plugins they depend on will follow suit. These major players are the first cracks in the ice across the ecosystem that will soon make Gutenberg-support the standard for any product that wants to compete.</p>\n<p>de Valk encouraged users to look at the advent of Gutenberg as a door to new opportunities during this transition time.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Gutenberg is not &#8216;done,\'&#8221; de Valk said. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s ready to ship, but I also think it opens up a world of new opportunities and discussions. It&#8217;s not all &#8216;right&#8217; yet either, so there will have to be changes as more people use it and get used to it. I do realize this is a drastic change in some ways. But it&#8217;s also not half as bad as people think it is. I have seen people use it for the first time, most people get used to it very quickly. Last but not least: you don&#8217;t have to switch now. The classic editor plugin exists for a reason. You can put off your switch for a year, or even two. But eventually I think everyone will see the power of the new editor and will switch.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 09 Aug 2018 21:54:16 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:100:\"WPTavern: Advanced Custom Fields to Add Gutenberg Compatibility in Version 5.0, Slated for September\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=83016\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:110:\"https://wptavern.com/advanced-custom-fields-to-add-gutenberg-compatibility-in-version-5-0-slated-for-september\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4880:\"<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-08-at-10.50.38-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Advanced Custom Fields</a> (ACF) team published an <a href=\"https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/blog/the-state-of-acf-in-a-gutenberg-world/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">announcement</a> today, assuring users that Gutenberg compatibility is in the works and will be available in version 5.0 of the free version in September 2018. The plugin, created by Elliot Condon, makes it easy for developers to add custom fields to WordPress edit screens, including posts, users, taxonomy terms, and media.</p>\n<p>ACF is widely used with more than a million active installations. Developers have been concerned about whether or not their custom fields would continue to work on their clients&#8217; websites after the new editor makes its debut in WordPress 5.0.</p>\n<p>Gutenberg treats legacy metaboxes as second class citizens in the interface, stuffed at the bottom of the new edit screen. Metaboxes should, however, continue to work as expected. The ACF announcement lets developers know what to expect for how their metaboxes will appear inside Gutenberg:</p>\n<blockquote><p>By default, our beloved metaboxes are pushed all the way to the bottom of the screen in an awkward attempt to retain compatibility. This placement feels very much like an afterthought from the Gutenberg developers and creates a disjointed editing experience for those of us (1+ million awesome ACF users) who extend the edit screens with extra fields.</p>\n<p>While this setup isn’t ideal, we will continue to work within the system to ensure that ACF is integrated into the Gutenberg UI to the fullest extent possible.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The free version of ACF will introduce Gutenberg compatibility in its version 5 release, which is slated for early September 2018. The compatibility update will only apply to version 5 and later, so the ACF team urges developers to running 4.x to upgrade to 5 as soon as it becomes available. Developers can also elect to upgrade early by turning on ACF&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/upgrade-guide-version-5/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Early Access</a> feature.</p>\n<p>The most surprising news is that ACF is introducing its own &#8220;ACF Blocks,&#8221; an <code>acf_register_block()</code> function that allows developers to register their own custom blocks without having to learn JavaScript.</p>\n<blockquote><p>One of the big selling points of Gutenberg is the ability for developers to create custom blocks.

Without the right tools, it can be overwhelming to simply get started building even the most basic theme.</p><cite>Justin Tadlock</cite></blockquote>\n\n<p>While starter themes are nothing new in the WordPress space, Mythic and <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-rig-a-wordpress-starter-theme-and-build-process-in-one\">WP Rig</a> take things to the next level and relatively share the same goal of providing a modern foundation to develop on top of. </p>\n\n<p>Part of the inspiration to build Mythic began two years ago. In trying to revamp the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/news/\">News theme</a>, Tadlock became frustrated with how difficult it was to use old coding methods and dropped the project.<br />><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&#8220;In a lot of ways, it was the catalyst that started me down this road toward Mythic,&#8221; Tadlock said. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t realize it at the time. But, that&#8217;s where some of my frustration began with modern theme building.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Mythic supports PHP 5.6+ although Tadlock is strongly pushing developers towards PHP 7+. &#8220;Anything earlier than 5.6 means for clunky code that’s just a headache to maintain,&#8221; he said. &#8220;WordPress, as a community, needs to be pushing people to update.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Support for SASS, LESS, CSS, and Stylus are built-in and developers can choose which language they prefer for builds. ES6+ was chosen for JavaScript and is commonly used for building Gutenberg blocks. </p>\n\n<p>Mythic comes with <a href=\"http://getbem.com/\">BEM</a> or Block-Element-Modifier. BEM is a methodology that enables developers to create reusable elements and sharing code in front-end environments. </p>\n\n<p>&#8220;BEM is a popular solution because it goes hand-in-hand with modern CSS pre-processors,&#8221; Tadlock said. &#8220;It also allows you to keep your styles flat and not get lost in <em>specificity hell</em>. This means smaller, faster stylesheets that are easier to override when you, a child theme author, or user need to do something custom.&#8221; The starter theme uses <a href=\"https://webpack.js.org/\">Webpack</a> in combination with <a href=\"https://github.com/JeffreyWay/laravel-mix\">Laravel Mix</a> to manage assets and modules.<br /></p>\n\n<p>Mythic has an <a href=\"https://themehybrid.com/weblog/working-with-the-view-class\">extended View class</a> that allows theme authors to use their preferred folder structure. Theme authors can also add custom data to theme templates. According to Tadlock, both features are not part of WordPress&#8217; native templating system. </p>\n\n<p>In addition to Mythic, Tadlock has continued to work on the <a href=\"https://themehybrid.com/hybrid-core\">Hybrid Core </a>framework. Hybrid Core is a required dependency that is added via Composer. </p>\n\n<p>Using Mythic with Hybrid Core exposes developers to features of the framework that they otherwise may not discover. &#8220;I rewrote nearly all of HC5 from scratch,&#8221; he said. &#8220;As a result, it’s leaner, more organized, and more cohesive.&#8221; The starter theme is also Gutenberg-ready.<br /></p>\n\n<h2>Tadlock Experiments with Sponsorship Pricing Model<br /></h2>\n\n<p>Mythic is in open beta and available for free via <a href=\"https://github.com/justintadlock/mythic\">GitHub</a>. The <a href=\"https://themehybrid.com/themes/mythic\">pricing model</a> is an honor system experiment. Tadlock is asking those who build projects for clients and generating a profit, to make a $99 sponsorship purchase. For commercially-sold themes, he is asking for $199. Both packages come with one year of support and access to the company&#8217;s Slack channel. <br /></p>\n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m still taking feedback on the payment system,&#8221; Tadlock said. &#8220;It could change. There have been a few suggestions more of a lifetime/flat fee. I&#8217;d prefer to just get some generous sponsors and keep it all $free. We&#8217;ll see where that goes in this next month of the beta process.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Mythic&#8217;s beta ends on September 3rd in which he&#8217;ll release version 1.0. Until then, he is trying to get as much feedback as possible from developers.

This new module ports WordPress&#8217; Gutenberg editor over to Drupal. It was created by Per André Rønsen and his team <a href=\"https://www.frontkom.no/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Frontkom</a>, a digital services agency based in Norway.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://drupalgutenberg.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Drupal Gutenberg</a> project aims to provide a new publishing experience based on WordPress&#8217; Gutenberg editor. The <a href=\"https://drupalgutenberg.org/demo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">live demo</a> on the site currently provides a frontend interactive implementation of Gutenberg inside Drupal, similar to WordPress&#8217; &#8220;Frontenberg&#8221; demo on <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">wordpress.org/gutenberg</a>. The latest implementation of the module will appear there but Rønsen said it is currently being revamped, as lots of things have happened with Gutenberg in the past few weeks.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/drupal-gutenberg.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<h3>How the Drupal Gutenberg Project was Born</h3>\n<p>Rønsen told us he first saw Gutenberg in 2017 and was inspired to use it for one of Frontkom&#8217;s media clients.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The thought of forking it came mid-2017, as we explored using Gutenberg as a lib for making a front page builder sponsored by the Google Digital News Initiative,&#8221; Rønsen said. &#8220;We ended up using it, and the Drupal module is a natural spin off.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Frontkom tailored the Gutenberg-based page builder for the media industry. It adds extra functionality to Gutenberg that allows users to position and tweak articles for the front page of an online newspaper. Rønsen said the project went well and his team plans to open source it but it&#8217;s too early to share anything right now.</p>\n<p>Following this successful experience using Gutenberg for a client, Frontkom began work on the Drupal Gutenberg project in early January 2018.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The main part of the work was to make Gutenberg more CMS agnostic,&#8221; Rønsen said. &#8220;First we forked it and maintained a fork. Later we started using Gutenberg as a dependency, testing a more maintainable approach.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Rønsen opened a ticket on GitHub, requesting that the Gutenberg team consider <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/2780\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">structuring the project to be more CMS-agnostic</a>. The ticket was closed fairly soon with the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/2780#issuecomment-342569414\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">explanation</a> that it &#8220;doesn&#8217;t relate directly to the work going on with the project and its goals.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have very little, if any, upstream commits so far, as the WP core interest has been to just cater to WP needs so far,&#8221; Rønsen said. &#8220;But that just changed.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gutenberg is moving towards making it easier to use outside of WordPress. The team is working on <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/3955\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">publishing all the React modules as npm packages</a>. Rønsen said he anticipates that decreasing the number of globals needed to make Gutenberg work will be a huge help for other CMSs.</p>\n<p>So far the Drupal Gutenberg project has not been shared widely but Rønsen said his team has seen a lot of interest from the Drupal tech community.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have a blog post coming in English with more detail; we kind of saved it for after holidays,&#8221; Rønsen said. &#8220;But then it blew up, and devs keep contacting us wanting to help out.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Frontkom has been involved in the Drupal community for more than 10 years and WordPress for the past three years. Rønsen and his team believe that Gutenberg fills a gap in the Drupal space.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Drupal doesn&#8217;t have all those fancy WordPress page builders,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So that is really more interesting than just a new post edit UI – we want a unified way to build complex layouts.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Drupal already has an initiative for revamping its admin UI using React, and Rønsen said he thinks Gutenberg might contribute to how this can happen in Drupal core. In an ideal world, many open source projects could greatly benefit from a CMS-agnostic Gutenberg, with all of them contributing together towards its improvement.</p>\n<p>&#8220;To us as a company, it is extremely interesting to build out front-ends that can easily be moved between CMSs,&#8221; Rønsen said. &#8220;For open source CMSs in general, I think there will be a lot to learn from the implementation process. For example, D8 has the concept of &#8216;everything is a block.&#8217; This has made it easy for us to make Drupal core blocks available in Gutenberg – we just need to do some magic to expose block settings.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Frontkom team are not only enthusiastic fans of Gutenberg&#8217;s interface, but also appreciate the way the project is run. Rønsen hasn&#8217;t been following the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-plugin-garners-mixed-reactions-from-new-wave-of-testers\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">community reaction to the latest round of Gutenberg testing</a> but said he thinks WordPress users will love it long term, since &#8220;most of the page builders out there have issues.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Drupal can learn a lot from WordPress, the way they actually built the Gutenberg project – a transparent design process, lots of collaboration, and still highly efficient,&#8221; Rønsen said. &#8220;So, WordPress is definitely ahead of Drupal with regards to their admin UI/JS work. Since there is already a lot of interest in the Drupal community to do something similar, it is very refreshing to see someone go through it and succeed (hopefully).&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/stevector\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Steve Persch</a>, lead developer advocate at Pantheon, spoke at DrupalCon in Nashville 2018 about <a href=\"https://events.drupal.org/nashville2018/sessions/whats-possible-wordpress-50\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">what&#8217;s possible with WordPress 5.0</a> and also gave a session at Twin Cities Drupal Camp titled &#8220;<a href=\"https://2018.tcdrupal.org/session/everything-block-how-wordpress-rewrote-wysiwyg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Everything is a Block: How WordPress Rewrote the WYSIWYG</a>.&#8221; In response to buzz on Twitter about the Drupal Gutenberg session, Persch <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stevector/status/1026461967630983169\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> Drupal needs an editorial UX improvement to stay competitive, but not necessarily by adopting Gutenberg.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have in-progress initiatives toward that end,&#8221; Persch said. &#8220;Gutenberg itself could turn into a distraction from that work. In both [presentations] I also mentioned that Paragraphs or Layout Builder could be better data model starting points for Gutenberg-like functionality. Delivering exactly the same thing as WordPress would be self-defeating. Structured content is the heart of Drupal. I see Gutenberg (or something like it) as a better UI for the corner of the data model (the Paragraphs part) that Drupal sites have had for years.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It will be interesting to see how different open source communities approach Gutenberg and how more diverse feedback from outside of WordPress could impact the project.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/sandbox/marcofernandes/2981601\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Drupal Gutenberg module</a> can be downloaded from the project page.

The goal of the prompt is to get more users testing the new editor and to raise awareness. Within the first 72 hours of the prompt going into user dashboards, sites with Gutenberg installed have shot up to more than 80,000, a 300% increase. The plugin has been downloaded more than 147,000 times in the past week.</p>\n<p>Gutenberg feedback is pouring in from a wave of new testers, most of whom are finding out about the new editor for the first time. Reactions have varied widely across multiple social networks. The announcement on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/WordPress/posts/10156301634992911\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress&#8217; official Facebook account</a> attracted many drive-by style comments that included negative reactions, confusion, and questions, with a few positive comments peppered in between.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Blocks aren’t doing it for me.

Gutenberg reviews are currently at a 2.4-star average, slipping from the 2.7-star average it held prior to the 4.9.8 release.

However, there are many reasons why a tester might be motivated to write a negative review. Some may have ignored the advice not to use it in production, some may be testing it with incompatible plugins, some may not want any changes to their established workflow, and some may simply not like the interface.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-05-at-10.24.03-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>While it may seem that the plugin has been widely panned by new testers, those who are the most critical tend to be more motivated to write a review.

The invitation has already succeeded at pulling out some quality feedback if you can sort through all the casual, angry one-liners.</p>\n<p>Steven Peters opened a lengthy <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/in-one-word-no-please-read-full-review/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">review</a> with the following observations about the more cumbersome and unintuitive aspects of Gutenberg&#8217;s interface:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The interface is not cohesive in its design. For example, To place a block of a paragraph, a heading, a subheading, a bullet list and every other block, the user must click the + sign every single time, making it that much harder to ‘go with the flow’ of writing, and is cumbersome and time-consuming. Time-consuming: a click for each block instead of just writing. More clicks equal wasted time.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In a review titled &#8220;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/lots-of-potential-but-too-soon-for-core/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Lots of potential but too soon for core</a>,&#8221; Mark Wilkinson details several specific usability issues:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The interface I find confusing – I think it is because it is too minimal. I found that it was all too easy to add a block by mistake and then not knowing what the block was or why it was there.</p>\n<p>There is too much reliance on hover effects, with things appearing and disappearing all the time. I also find it hard to know where the focus is on the screen as it just uses a faint grey border.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Several reviewers were candid about their distaste for the concept of putting content into blocks. The Gutenberg team has readily communicated its vision for the block-based editor, but this tends to speak more to developers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Why does every little thing have to be in a separate block?&#8221; one reviewer <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/im-not-change-resistant-but-this-has-a-way-to-go/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">asked</a> before describing multiple usability issues with current block behavior. &#8220;That is a feature I think I actually detest. I do not want 50 zillion little fussy blocks on a page. I had entire blocks just disappear on me and a lot of the time, I was initially unsure of exactly what I did to make them disappear. This is bad. Some of the time it was placing a block, like an image block, and then deleting the image … the entire block went, which meant I had to go through the motions to add the block, then add an image block again, and then add my image again. Lame.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Multiple reviewers commented that previously simple tasks are much more complicated in Gutenberg. Others said after reading official replies to reviews, they felt that leaving specific feedback was a waste of time. Canned responses from the Gutenberg team gave some the impression that their feedback wasn&#8217;t heard or valued.</p>\n<blockquote><p>My feeling while reading the WordPress developer responses is that that they have no intention of either stopping or postponing Gutenberg no matter what bug or problem is given to their attention. &#8211; <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/can-i-just-interject-here/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@lauritasita</a></p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>I have read all the reviews (and also the Gutenberg-lovers’ replies) and it seems that it is not really a discussion. The question on what is missing in this editor is useless if people simply do not want such a feature in their install. All you do is trying to convince people that it would only take time to get used to a modern technology. In my eyes this is bullshit. I myself love new features – if they are useful. &#8211; <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/time-to-respect-your-users-matt/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@peg20</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>Based on the responses to reviews, it isn&#8217;t clear to testers whether the Gutenberg team is willing to make major changes to re-design features that are not easy to use or whether they are simply combing the reviews for feedback on bugs with the existing interface.</p>\n<h3>Classic Editor Plugin Installations are on the Rise as Users Prepare for WordPress 5.0</h3>\n<p>In the days following WordPress 4.9.8&#8217;s release, active installations of the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Classic Editor</a> plugin have jumped from 7,000 to 60,000, a 757% increase.

When WordPress 5.0 lands, neither way should be seen as the &#8216;correct&#8217; way &#8211; they&#8217;re both entirely legitimate.&#8221;</p>\n<p>One major theme in both positive and negative reviews of the plugin is the desire for Gutenberg to be opt-in for WordPress 5.0, instead of having it auto-enabled for all users.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The \"Try Gutenberg\" callout in WordPress 4.9.8 looks great!

For millions of other WordPress users without their own developers or engineering teams, discovering Gutenberg auto-enabled after updating to WordPress 5.0 will be a moment of reckoning.

Hundreds of high quality free stock photo sites have cropped up on the web over the past few years, but Pexels is differentiating itself with a commitment to hosting diversity-focused images and videos that represent a wide range of experiences. WordPress.com is working with them and other partners to <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/read/feeds/25823/posts/1945569908\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">make more diverse images available to users</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Stock-image libraries have historically struggled to represent all experiences, and often excluded photos of people of color, people with disabilities, or non-binary individuals. Pexels is working to change that, and since partnering with them we’ve helped incorporate diversity-focused libraries to their collection. Ultimately, we believe it’s on us to help find a solution to this problem, and avoid generic stock images that often perpetuate stereotypes.</p></blockquote>\n<p>WordPress.com users can access the images via the Add Media button. Self-hosted site owners with Jetpack-enabled sites can also access the library when composing new posts on WordPress.com. Automattic happiness engineer Anne McCarthy posted a demo of where to find the new images:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cloudup.com/c-ZzCzFS1Rn\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/cldup.com/mJOr5iicyD.gif?resize=627%2C348&ssl=1\" alt=\"Media\" width=\"627\" height=\"348\" /></a></p>\n<p>More than 1,000 developers and companies are using the <a href=\"https://www.pexels.com/api/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Pexels API</a>. The site regularly hosts diversity-focused photo <a href=\"https://www.pexels.com/challenges/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">challenges</a> with prizes for the best submissions. Photographers who are inspired to contribute can submit their work to the library but should be aware of its <a href=\"https://www.pexels.com/photo-license\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">open license</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I like the idea, and, as a photoblogger, I’m open to sharing my images,&#8221; one reader commented on the announcement. &#8220;But I [think] the license rules are too open (for me).

The prices for each pass were as follows:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Personal Pass: $199</li><li>Extended Pass: $399</li><li>Professional Pass: $699</li><li>All Access Pass: $899</li></ul>\n\n<p>After six weeks, Williamson noticed that customers were continuing to purchase individual extensions instead of the passes. </p>\n\n<p>&#8220;Our expectation and intent in creating the passes was for store owners to be able to purchase access to multiple individual extensions in a more economical way, but that’s not what happened,&#8221; he said. </p>\n\n<p>&#8220;Instead, store owners continued to purchase only the individual extensions they needed because the price tags of the passes were still too high. It is clear that we made a mistake in our pass pricing, and so today we’d like to apologize for that and announce new, lower prices.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>After two weeks of testing, the prices of each pass have been significantly reduced to the following amounts:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Personal Pass: <strong>$99</strong></li><li>Extended Pass: <strong>$199</strong></li><li>Professional Pass: <strong>$299</strong></li><li>All Access Pass: <strong>$499</strong><strong></strong><strong></strong></li></ul>\n\n<p>In addition to the pricing changes, customers who purchased a pass between June 1st and August 1st are eligible for a refund. The refund is equal to the difference of the purchased price and the new price. Customers have until August 15th, to <a href=\"https://easydigitaldownloads.com/support\">request a refund</a>. <br /></p>\n\n<p>Customers who purchased passes before the reduction will have their renewal amounts automatically changed to the lower price. </p>\n\n<p>Pricing WordPress products and services is tough and requires experimentation. There are numerous <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/?s=pricing\">WordCamp sessions</a>, <a href=\"https://kinsta.com/blog/how-to-price-a-product-wordpress/\">articles</a>, and <a href=\"https://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/pricing-your-wordpress-services/\">in-depth guides</a> on the subject but there&#8217;s not one answer that&#8217;s best for every business. </p>\n\n<p>Publicly admitting to a pricing mistake is one thing, but offering refunds to try to get customers on equal footing is going the extra mile.</p>\n\n<p>The company could have handled things in a way that&#8217;s not as beneficial to customers, but they chose what I think is a commendable way. Williamson&#8217;s closing statement speaks about the way he leads his company and how he makes these types of decisions.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>While we are far from perfect, as this pricing mistake clearly indicates, we are dedicated to doing right by our customers. To each of you, we would like to extend our most sincere thanks for sticking with us as we work through these changes</p><cite>Pippin Williamson</cite></blockquote>\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a luxury to have business owners like Williamson in the WordPress economy. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 02 Aug 2018 01:00:41 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:95:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg 3.4 Adds New Warning to Classic Editor When Editing Posts Containing Blocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=82772\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:106:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-3-4-adds-new-warning-to-classic-editor-when-editing-posts-containing-blocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2614:\"<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/07/31/whats-new-in-gutenberg-30th-july/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg 3.4</a> was released yesterday with fixes intended to prepare the plugin for converting existing content to blocks.

Because of that strange sense of time and action I’ve always been quite fond of the quote from Lewis Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland</p>\n<p>“Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop.”<br />\nBut where, for this story, is the beginning?</p>\n<p>It was a lifetime of choices and serendipitous encounters that led me down the path to WordPress and eventually Automattic. And those same types of choices and encounters that keep me here.</p>\n<h2>Begin at the Beginning&#8230;</h2>\n<p>I was a youngish mother of a youngish child and a full time stay at home parent. I didn’t work outside the home; I was raising my kid. That was both a privilege and a problem. I realized that, as a mother consumed with caring for this new human, I was beginning to lose the very strong sense of identity that I’d always had.</p>\n<p>This was my first experience with not knowing who I was. I always knew who I was, even if I didn’t know who I wanted to be. As a mother though, most of who I am was sucked into caring for my family. Not sleeping. Not taking proper care of myself. Not taking time for my interests. Putting the others in my house before me and saying that it was what I wanted.</p>\n<p><em>Narrator: It wasn’t.</em></p>\n<p>There was a pivot point. A moment before my daughter turned three. When I realized that if she were to choose to become a mother I would not want her to go down the same path of self denial that I had. I would want her to be who she is first and a mother second so that she could be the best self and mother she could be.</p>\n<p>And I realized that was something I could only show by example. But how to start? I’d always been a writer. I often say that I only learned to read so that I could write. Journaling, short stories, poetry. Sometimes just long strings of thoughts and observations that wouldn’t leave my head until I wrote them down. I would write out long “stories” on MySpace about my experiences and realizations. I would scrawl poetry on scrap paper laying around the house. None of it was enough.</p>\n<p>Also, as I understand is fairly typical for a stay at home parent, I had no one to talk to most of the time except for my small child. And while she was super awesome and receptive to any conversation I may want to start, they all tended to transition to discussion of My Little Ponies or a request for ice cream or screen time. So I looked for something more. For a place to discuss the mommified version of myself with no one and everyone. I started a blog.</p>\n<p>But it wasn’t on WordPress.</p>\n<h2>Go On…</h2>\n<p>I wrote and I wrote and I wrote. My experiences, my kid’s experiences. Dreams and hopes and bad poetry. And I found a group of people who shared with me their struggles and dreams as they dove into mine. A web of women and men who got me. Who got what I was going through. Who got what I was doing. A community of individuals, not all like minded, but all understanding.</p>\n<p>And then one day I was asked to write for a city blog, and then another. And as my writing began to expand I found other communities. My sense of self was first preserved but then invigorated and it grew and I stretched my arms and I stretched my wings and I realized I was beginning to feel whole for the first time in a long while.</p>\n<p>But using multiple platforms for my blogging gave me the understanding that the platform I was using was restrictive and unsatisfying. Clunky.</p>\n<p>And that’s when a friend mentioned WordCamp Portland. It was this new thing. We were doing it for the first time. A bunch of bloggers getting together to talk about WordPress and blogging and stuff.</p>\n<p>I had no idea what WordPress was. But my friend said they needed some volunteers to help out, and I’m always one to support my friends, my community. So I asked what I needed to do to help.</p>\n<p>“Move your blog to WordPress”</p>\n<p>And so I did. And something clicked. Once I had moved to a WordPress site I found my passion for blogging was something more. I played with themes, I made headers that felt like art pieces, I helped others transfer their content, set up their sites. I introduced them to a community that I was just beginning to get to know.</p>\n<p>And then there was a cascade of activity. More blogs, podcasting, events, community, and every year there was WordCamp Portland. And I continued to learn and grow my skills as a writer, as a blogger, as a podcaster, and as a WordPresser. I continued to volunteer, and then to speak, and to help organize.</p>\n<h2>And on…</h2>\n<p>But life changes. Sometimes for the better sometimes for the worse. But change is hard. People change or stay the same. Relationships change. Life changes. Sometimes all of the above. So I ended a marriage and found myself stumped. I knew who I was, but who I happened to be was a stay at home mom who hadn’t worked outside the home in eight years and had no marketable skills that I could find that would also allow me to continue to be home for my kid.</p>\n<p>And I panicked and I procrastinated and then I found an opening. A small startup I knew through my interactions with the community needed a customer support person who also knew WordPress.</p>\n<p>A light went on. And I had a job for the first time in eight years. And I knew what I was doing. And I was good at it. And I continued to blog. A little. And I stuck to the little tiny fringes of the WordPress community I knew. Still not realizing how big the rest of it was.</p>\n<p>The Portland WordPress folks were like a river feeding into the ocean of the worldwide community. But I’d only ever stood on the shores of the river and dipped my toes in. All that was about to change.</p>\n<h2>Till You Come to the End…</h2>\n<p>But as I said at the beginning, it’s not that simple. There is no end. There is just more. More stories, more people, more learning, more community. And that’s where we begin the part of the story that tells us where I am today.</p>\n<p>This part begins with an email from a community friend with a link to a job posting. And a new beginning.</p>\n<p>I was working happily at that small startup, spreading my wings. But starting to feel a little bit like my passion wasn’t being put to use when that email arrived. A link to a job posting working as a sponsored volunteer within the WordPress community and question. It was a simple question. “Do you know anyone who would kick ass at this job?”</p>\n<p>DID I? I was reeling from the possibility and doubled over with imposter syndrome and fear. Fear that I wasn’t good enough. Fear that they wouldn’t like me. Fear that I’d be leaving my boss in the lurch.</p>\n<p>So I did what I always did at that time. And what I still do to this day. I procrastinated. I talked. I thought. I woke up in the middle of the night in a panic thinking I had forgotten something. Thinking I had done something wrong.</p>\n<p>But as I sat there one day tinkering on the startup’s site, scheduling posts, checking in on our customers all while getting my daughter ready for school that morning I realized that it was time to set aside those fears. To look that imposter syndrome right in the eye and say “not today” and I started putting together my resume and working on the cover email.</p>\n<p>No one was more surprised than I when I found myself two months later starting my first day at Automattic.</p>\n<p>It’s been about 5 and a half years since that email landed in my inbox. It’s been more than a decade since WordPress landed in my heart and I’m proud to make my living in the wide wonderful world of WordPress. As I write this story for all of you to read—not a cautionary tale I hope, but an inspirational one—I’m just a few days away from the end of my three-month sabbatical (a benefit that all Automatticians are eligible for after 5 years.)</p>\n<p>It’s been a time of rest, readjustment, relaxation. Of edification. But it’s also been a renewal. A time to look back at how I got where I am and remember how lucky I am to be here today. And I owe it all to a little bit of gumption and to the amazing community of WordPressers who opened their world to me. And also to everyone else who is willing to be a part of this great big community founded on open source. On WordPress.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: Begin at the Beginning\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Begin%20at%20the%20Beginning&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fbegin-at-the-beginning%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: Begin at the Beginning\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fbegin-at-the-beginning%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fbegin-at-the-beginning%2F&title=Begin+at+the+Beginning\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: Begin at the Beginning\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/begin-at-the-beginning/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/080118-150x150.jpg&description=Begin at the Beginning\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: Begin at the Beginning\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/begin-at-the-beginning/\" title=\"Begin at the Beginning\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/begin-at-the-beginning/\">Begin at the Beginning</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 01 Aug 2018 08:00:57 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"Cami Kaos\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:86:\"WPTavern: WordPress 4.9.8 RC 3 Released, Limits ‘Try Gutenberg’ Callout Visibility\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=82803\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:90:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-9-8-rc-3-released-limits-try-gutenberg-callout-visibility\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1701:\"<p>WordPress 4.9.8 Release Candidate 3 <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/07/31/wordpress-4-9-8-release-candidate-3/\">is available</a> for testing.

In April, the platform <a href=\"https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2018/04/24/new-facebook-platform-product-changes-policy-updates/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> sweeping changes to the publish_actions permission, which allowed apps to publish to users&#8217; timeline on their behalf.</p>\n<blockquote><p>On August 1st, 2018, the Live API publish_actions permission, which allows an app to publish on behalf of its Users, will be reserved for approved partners. A new permission model that allows apps to publish Videos to their User&#8217;s Groups and Timeline will be created instead.</p>\n<p>Access to the Pages APIs requires re-submission of the application for review before August 1, 2018. This will be required to continue publishing live and VOD video to Pages, as well as reading insights.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Facebook is notorious for swiftly changing its APIs in ways that break apps (sometimes without warning), often sending developers scrambling. For a long time, apps auto-posting to user timelines was part of the wild west of app permissions granted without much oversight from Facebook. Users often unknowingly gave permission to apps that would collect data and spam their Facebook connections with posts made on their behalf.</p>\n<p>Those days are over, but an unfortunate byproduct of this restriction is that apps like WordPress.com and Jetpack&#8217;s Publicize feature can no longer automatically publish posts to user timelines. This change also adversely affects apps like Buffer and Hootsuite that allow users to schedule and publish posts to their social accounts.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://jetpack.com/2018/07/30/jetpack-6-3-3-facebook-publicize/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jetpack 6.3.3</a> removes the ability for users to select Facebook Profile connections and displays a notice regarding existing connections, so users will be aware of which auto-posting connections they are losing. Besides Jetpack, this Facebook API change affects tens of thousands of users who have this functionality implemented through one of many other plugins on WordPress.org.</p>\n<p>Users are now required to manually share their posts to their timelines. They can no longer schedule content to be shared to Facebook at specific times for different audiences.</p>\n<p>Auto-posting to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/175644189234902/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Facebook Pages</a> still works, and one option users have is to convert their Profile to a Page or set up a new page. This may not be a suitable alternative for bloggers and those whose writing is not attached to a business or an organization.</p>\n<p>In a recent <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2018/07/my-recode-decode-interview-with-kara-swisher/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> on his blog, Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg commented on Facebook&#8217;s decision to turn off auto-posting to profiles.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As it turns out, Facebook also is turning off the ability for WordPress sites — and all websites — to post directly to users’ profile pages,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;The decision to shut down the API is ostensibly to fight propaganda and misinformation on the platform, but I think it’s a big step back for their embrace of the open web. I hope they change their minds.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If only a select few &#8220;approved partners&#8221; are allowed to automatically broadcast to user timelines, it puts smaller players at a disadvantage, requiring manual sharing each time they publish. Facebook is setting itself up as a gatekeeper that enables news from a small selection of partners to keep pumping through the platform on schedule. Individual voices on smaller websites are no longer able to syndicate to the Facebook platform unless they decide to create a Page.</p>\n<p>Put a different way, the only syndicated content allowed on Facebook will be through channels the company can monetize &#8211; business/organization Pages or partners who are approved to post to user timelines. Users who care about retaining their Facebook audiences will need to remember to manually post their content to the social network after August 1, 2018, when the API changes go into effect.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 31 Jul 2018 22:11:30 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:50:\"Matt: My Recode Decode Interview with Kara Swisher\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=48262\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"https://ma.tt/2018/07/my-recode-decode-interview-with-kara-swisher/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1780:\"<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;We want to make the best tools in the world, and we want to do it for decades to come.

He encouraged attendees at his session to venture outside of WordCamps and said he hopes to see more collaboration across the platforms in the future.

The Gutenberg handbook has an <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/handbook/extensibility/theme-support/\">excellent article</a> on how to opt-in and add support for enhanced features.</p>\n\n<p>Most themes will present the default blocks without any issues as the blocks themselves provide their own styles. If you use a theme that does not fully support Gutenberg such as the Wide or Full Block Alignment options, the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-support-for-gutenberg/\">Theme Support for Gutenberg</a> plugin may be for you. </p>\n\n<p>Created by <a href=\"https://weavertheme.com/about/\">Weweaver</a>, Theme Support for Gutenberg claims to allow most WordPress themes to be compatible with Gutenberg. In addition to theme support, the plugin adds a Classic Editor button to the admin bar to easily switch between Gutenberg and the Classic Editor.</p>\n\n<p>Since a default WordPress theme is used to show how this plugin is beneficial, I decided to try it for myself. I installed the plugin on a fresh install of WordPress 4.9.7, Gutenberg 3.3, and the latest version of Twenty Sixteen. I published a Gutenberg Demo post which uses many of the default blocks.<br /></p>\n\n<h2>Twenty Sixteen Looks Better Without It<br /></h2>\n\n<p>Here is what the Gallery block looks like in Twenty Sixteen with the plugin disabled. The content looks good and fits within the content column.</p>\n\n<img />Theme Support for Gutenberg Disabled\n\n<p>When the plugin is enabled, the images are so large, a horizontal scroll bar appears. </p>\n\n<img />Theme Support for Gutenberg Enabled\n\n<p>The plugin includes additional styling for default blocks. One block that doesn&#8217;t benefit from the enhanced styles is the Video block. With the plugin disabled, the video block appears normally. </p>\n\n<img />Video Block With The Plugin Disabled<br />\n\n<p>With the plugin enabled, the video block overflows the content column and breaches into the left sidebar.</p>\n\n<img />Video Block With The Plugin Enabled \n\n<p>Although the plugin initially shipped with no options, version 0.2 includes new settings that provide better compatibility for some themes. I checked the box to disable Fitvids support which solved the video block issue. However, the other options had no effect on the oversized image blocks. <br /></p>\n\n<img />Theme Support Options\n\n<p>Twenty Sixteen and Twenty Seventeen do not work well with this plugin. There may be themes, particularly older ones that benefit, but more modern themes will likely be ok without it. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 27 Jul 2018 22:42:22 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"WPTavern: WooSesh Virtual WooCommerce Conference to be Held October 18-19\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=82508\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:84:\"https://wptavern.com/woosesh-virtual-woocommerce-conference-to-be-held-october-18-19\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4964:\"<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/woosesh-2018.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://woosesh.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WooSesh</a>, a new two-day virtual conference focused on WooCommerce topics, will be held October 18-19. While wrapping up another successful edition of WordSesh, Brian Richards announced WooSesh as the next event coming under the WordSesh brand. On Wednesday, nearly 500 attendees joined WordSesh. People tuned in from around the world, although the audience was heavily US-based due to the time the event was scheduled.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/wordsesh-july-2018.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Since WooConf is not happening this year, WooSesh is an exciting alternative that will be accessible to anyone in the world. Co-organizers Brian Richards and Patrick Rauland will be hosting eight presentations each day, so the event will last between 8-10 hours both days, including breaks and announcements.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Once we learned that WooConf wouldn’t be taking place this year we reached out to our friends at Automattic to see if we could work with them as well to still provide a high-quality event but for a much more global audience,&#8221; Richards said.</p>\n<p>WooCommerce is sponsoring the entire event, making it free for all live attendees. Richards said they are working with other prominent companies in the WooCommerce space who are lending their knowledgeable staff as presenters, as well as providing the event with digital swag for attendees.</p>\n<p>WooSesh organizers are employing an interesting concept for encouraging attendance and engagement. The conference will have a $200 ticket price for those who do not attend live. Those who register in advance and attend live will receive the $200 ticket for free.</p>\n<p>&#8220;That means if a person joins the mailing list and shows up for the event, they’ll be able to experience the whole thing at no cost to them,&#8221; Richards said. &#8220;Similar to WordSesh, a ticket grants attendees access to the entire broadcast, chat, recordings, real-time transcriptions, and some cool digital swag. But with WooSesh they’ll also get some targeted follow-up content, and perhaps a private community, to further help them succeed and increase the impact of this conference.</p>\n<p>&#8220;And I think it’s in everyone’s best interest to register and attend live – at least trying to make it to one of the sessions across the two days – so they can get all of that for free.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Richards said recordings may still make it out there for people to view afterwards but none of the other perks and follow-ups will be available without purchasing a ticket or attending live.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We talked about asking people for a credit card up front and building a mechanism that would either charge them after the fact (like a pre-order) or charge them up-front but then refund them after the fact,&#8221; Richards said. &#8220;Instead we’re going with the simpler route and asking only for a person’s name and email address up-front. If they come to the live event they’ll be able to access all of the content afterwards just as if they had paid, and if they don’t attend live they’ll instead be greeted with a payment form.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Building on their collective knowledge of organizing successful in-person and virtual conferences, Richards said he and his co-organizer wanted to reduce the friction as much as possible for people getting into their seats and engaged with the speakers and other attendees.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Making it a virtual event already knocks down a ton of barriers,&#8221; Richard said. &#8220;Making the content available for free eliminates even more.

The open source vector icon font is used on more than <a href=\"https://trends.builtwith.com/widgets/Font-Awesome\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">22 million sites</a> across the internet. It&#8217;s also a popular icon font with WordPress theme and plugin developers.</p>\n<p>Version 5.2 introduces automotive and education categories, which should be useful to fill the gaps for designers and developers creating sites around these subjects. The release also adds 66 new and updated icons to the Medical category and 126 new and updated Maps icons.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/medical.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Font Awesome, originally created by Dave Gandy, is an SIL OFL-licensed icon font, with the code under the MIT License. Thanks to its GPL-friendly license, the icon font is widely used in WordPress&#8217; theme and plugin ecosystem in both commercial and free products. Font Awesome&#8217;s <a href=\"https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+wordpress\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Github issues queue</a> is also loaded with icon requests that would be used in niche WordPress themes, as well as icons for WordPress-related company logos.</p>\n<p>Two years ago, Font Awesome announced the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/font-awesome-cdn-now-in-beta-loads-icons-asynchronously-with-automatic-accessibility-best-practices\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">beta release of its new CDN</a>, which allows developers to implement it using a single line of code to bring the icons and CSS toolkit into their projects. At that time, Font Awesome was used by more than 300 plugins on WordPress.org. In 2018, searching the official plugin directory turns up more than 800 plugins that make use of the icon font in some way. Thousands of free and commercial themes also use it to provide users with easy customization options.</p>\n<p>Font Awesome support for Gutenberg is going to be fairly important, as hundreds of thousands of websites are using plugins like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/better-font-awesome/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Better Font Awesome</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/font-awesome-shortcodes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Font Awesome Shortcodes</a>, and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/font-awesome-4-menus/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Font Awesome for Menus</a> to allow users to add icons to content and menus.

In 2015, the Metadata UI project <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/05/27/metadata-api-project-reborn-the-new-fields-api-project/\">was reborn</a> as the <a href=\"https://github.com/sc0ttkclark/wordpress-fields-api\">Fields API</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The Fields API was developed to allow registering fields to different screens in the admin area through a single API. New meta boxes and fields within them could be added to posts while new sections and fields could be added to the profile screen.</p>\n\n<p>The goal of the API is to integrate with all of the various admin screens including, Posts, Terms, Users, Media, and Comments and provide standardization.</p>\n\n<p>Clark has been leading the project for three years and despite seeing <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-core-fields-api-project-sees-renewed-interest\">renewed interest</a> last year, <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/messages/C04MWK7PZ/\">announced</a> in the project&#8217;s Slack channel that he is stepping down. <br /></p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>It is with a heavy heart that I must pass the torch on this project.

I still believe to be such a vital part of WordPress&#8217; future success.</p><cite>Scott Kingsley Clark</cite></blockquote>\n\n<h2>The Trials and Tribulations of Leading an Open Source Project</h2>\n\n<p>In the following interview, Clark explains why he feels personally responsible for the project&#8217;s lack of progress, why the API is important for WordPress&#8217; future, and reflects on what he could have done differently.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Are you looking to pass the torch on to anyone in particular?</strong><br /><br /></p>\n\n<p>No, I&#8217;m not sure who would have the drive and the clout to see the project through. It&#8217;s a large scale project that should be approached with a long-term vision but in small enough increments to make it into WordPress core. It&#8217;s a lot to ask of somebody, it&#8217;s also not a priority for people right now since they are distracted by Gutenberg being released in the near future.<br /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Why is the Fields API a vital part of WordPress&#8217; future?</strong><br /><br /></p>\n\n<p>People look at WordPress today and wonder how they ever survived without the REST API. Well, at least I know I do! The same thing can be said about the Fields API even though it&#8217;s not there yet. There are so many cases where it&#8217;s frustrating to build solutions for WordPress across all of the different hooks.<br /></p>\n\n<p>For consistency, it&#8217;s the wild west out there. You get a meta box registered and you fill it with whatever you want. You need your own CSS to style the form fields and everyone has their own idea of how this interface should look. You are in charge of your own responsive layouts that are mobile-friendly, there&#8217;s just so much you have to handle on your own. You should be able to customize appearances, but every place you want to add a field or form to should really have a proper API.<br /></p>\n\n<p>Long-term, imagine registering fields to WordPress like you register post types. Imagine fields and their configurations being available to the REST API and accessible through the WordPress App or other custom apps. </p>\n\n<p>The whole world opens up because you have a consistent API, the whole world make sense because you have a consistent interface for those fields across the various edit screens. Posts, terms, comments, users, media, even the Customizer would all have the same underlying API to add groups, panels, and fields to their screens.<br /></p>\n\n<p>If Gutenberg was done after the Fields API was in, migration for folks wouldn&#8217;t have been as difficult. Gutenberg could have automatically shown all of the Fields API interfaces like it does for the meta box backward compatibility. It would have looked so much nicer too.<br /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Taking some time to reflect, what could you have done differently to get more core contributors to buy into the project and turn it into a higher priority?</strong><br /><br /></p>\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure, it&#8217;s a delicate balance of taking input and being confident in the end result. At first, the feedback was about how the API was foreign for WordPress, they asked if it could be similar in structure to other APIs such as the Customizer. </p>\n\n<p>We scrapped the code and rebuilt from the ground up as a fork of the Customizer, it even supported having the Customizer utilizing the Fields API too. At the height of development, we had all areas of the Fields API implemented.<br /></p>\n\n<p>Core releases were moving pretty fast, there was a lot of code changes from WordPress release to release that we had to keep up with because we had essentially created a project that was a giant patch for WordPress. </p>\n\n<p>There weren&#8217;t enough hooks in place to do what we needed to do, and many sections were not extensible because of code decisions that marked themselves as &#8216;final&#8217;, which means you can&#8217;t extend a specific class to customize how it works.<br /></p>\n\n<p>I wish I could have been at all the big WordCamps in the US and Europe, essentially lobbying for this feature. Gathering supporters and such, it feels like politics in a way. I hung around in Core dev meetings, trying to bring it up. I tried to legitimize the feature by having a dedicated channel in the official WordPress Slack, posting updates on<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\"> https://make.wordpress.org/core/</a>, and holding weekly meetings.<br /></p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, I prioritized my time for development over the time to gather the troops. That was the downfall, I began to burn out quickly after the first few rewrites as I had many other responsibilities elsewhere on top of Fields API.</p>\n\n<p>It’s not like companies will easily want to pay you to work on a project like this indefinitely, even though both WebDevStudios and 10up gave me time to push it forward. It wasn’t a blank check, at some point I had to get back to billable work. From then on, it was all in my free time and that was difficult to manage during times of financial stress and house selling/buying.<br /></p>\n\n<p><strong>There&#8217;s demand for a Fields API in core but not enough hands to build it. Why do you think that is?</strong><br /><br /></p>\n\n<p>Everyone is focused elsewhere. There’s a lot of areas of WordPress that need people’s attention. There are things like Accessibility that deserve a lot more attention than it gets. But the focus to me, seems to be on Gutenberg and REST API. </p>\n\n<p>Gutenberg especially has been a huge time sink for people contributing and people implementing. It’s a really large feature. It’s definitely larger in scale than Fields API, it’s like a whole new app that lives in WordPress. Integration with it has required a lot of education and trial/error. People’s focus is where it needs to be right now. It’s just unfortunate that Gutenberg came before Fields API in terms of priority and interest level.<br /></p>\n\n<p><strong>What advice would you give to the next Fields API project leader?</strong><br /><br /></p>\n\n<p>This is a big project, everyone will want to say it should be a certain way. You have to evaluate the options and put forth something bite sized for core to start with. Build upon that, but never lose sight of the long-term goal of integration across all of the WordPress screens. Even the front-end comment forms could thrive with the Fields API.<br /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Why do you feel personally responsible for the project not being a core priority?</strong><br /><br /></p>\n\n<p>At one point, we had momentum. We had at least three to four people who were active. It fell apart because I ran out of time. It’s my shortsightedness, it’s my fault. I spent hundreds of hours developing the project over a couple of years. I should have left myself much more time for organizing the feature proposal text and keeping the fires burning in our contributors’ hearts.<br /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Considering the time and effort you&#8217;ve put into the project the last few years, do you feel any sense of relief passing the torch on?</strong><br /><br /></p>\n\n<p>If the torch gets passed or picked up, I will feel a ton better. The main relief is that it’s officially not a weight I have to carry alone any longer. It’s okay to try and fail, it’s still sad though. </p>\n\n<p>I hope that someone or some company steps up and puts time into this. They could even reignite the fire in my own heart that burned itself out. For now, I have one less major to-do item. I still have a hefty plate but it’s no longer as heavy of a burden.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n<p>While the immediate future of the project is unclear, those interested in taking it over are encouraged to read posts marked with the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/fields-api/\">Fields API tag</a> on <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core\">Make.WordPress.Core</a> to learn about its history.

His concern is that if Google succeeds, it might &#8220;make a lot of the web&#8217;s history inaccessible.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Google makes a popular browser and is a tech industry leader,&#8221; Winer said. &#8220;They can, they believe, encircle the web, and at first warn users as they access HTTP content. Very likely they will do more, requiring the user to consent to open a page, and then to block the pages outright.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">BTW, if I had to guess, the *real* reason Google hates HTTP has to do with Google\'s ad revenue, and not wanting Verizon and Comcast to remove their ads and replace them with their own. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f61c.png\" alt=\"😜\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n<p>&mdash; scripting.com (@davewiner) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1021500417241427968?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 23, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Others have speculated that another driving factor behind Google&#8217;s push for HTTPS adoption may be its investment in <a href=\"https://www.i-programmer.info/news/87-web-development/11367-google-starts-its-push-to-progressive-web-apps-bye-bye-chrome-apps.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">advancing PWA technologies</a>, which require HTTPS to be enabled.

HTTPS is a requirement for the permission workflows, new features, and updated APIs that the company is using to build its future products.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s easy to see how HTTPS is critical for e-commerce, banking, and other sites that collect highly sensitive data from users, but many wonder if it is necessary for simple blogs and content websites. Google contends that <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/encrypt-in-transit/why-https\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">all websites need HTTPS protection</a> to prevent intruders from injecting ads or exploits.</p>\n<p>Few would dispute the value of HTTPS but critics are wary of Google establishing itself as the arbiter of safe browsing on the web.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">My blog, <a href=\"https://t.co/gPQ9VPYOLB\">https://t.co/gPQ9VPYOLB</a>, is not “not secure.” It uses the standard protocol of the web, HTTP.

Tomorrow, this plugin will have been in the WordPress.org Plugin Directory for 13 years (it was the 339th plugin in the WordPress plugin repository; there are now over 75,000!).</p>\n<p>To celebrate its transition to a teenager, I&#8217;ve added some new features and UI enhancements.</p>\n<p>Last month, I received survey responses from over 800 Page Links To users and learned a lot about how it&#8217;s being put to work. One of the most interesting things I found was how many people are using it for URL redirects. For example, they might have a really long URL on their own site or someone else&#8217;s site that they want to be nice. <em>example.com/summer-sale</em> instead of <em>example.com/store/specials.aspx?season=summer&amp;_utm_source=internal</em>. But in order to create these redirects, you have to go through the cluttered and sometimes slow post creation screen. All you really need to create a redirect is a title, a destination URL, and a local short URL.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll now find a menu item &#8220;Add Page Link&#8221; that will allow you to quickly add a redirected Page without having to wait for the entire WordPress post editing interface to load. It&#8217;s <em>super</em> fast, and it doesn&#8217;t redirect you away from the screen you&#8217;re on.</p>\n<p><img /></p>\n<p>Since short URLs are better for sharing (and remembering), the UI will give you a little push to shorten the URL if the one generated from your title is too long. From there, you can Save Draft or Publish.</p>\n<img />Hey, that URL is getting a bit long\n<img />Custom slug, for a better short URL\n<p>Additionally, this release includes a &#8220;link&#8221; indicator on post and page list screens, so you can easily see what items have been re-pointed with Page Links To. When hovered, the link icon will reveal the destination URL for a quick view.</p>\n<img />The &#8220;link&#8221; icon means that this item has been pointed elsewhere.\n<p>If you want to grab the &#8220;local&#8221; short URL (which will be redirected to your chosen URL when someone visits it), just click &#8220;Copy Short URL&#8221; from the actions, and it&#8217;ll be in your clipboard.</p>\n<img />Hover the &#8220;link&#8221; icon to see where it&#8217;s pointing.\n<p>That&#8217;s it for version 3.0, but I&#8217;ll have more to announce soon — stay tuned!</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 23 Jul 2018 22:02:18 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"Mark Jaquith\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"WPTavern: Thoughts From Two Founders Who Recently Sold Their WordPress Businesses\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=82531\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"https://wptavern.com/thoughts-from-two-founders-who-recently-sold-their-wordpress-businesses\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2299:\"<p>Last month, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-engine-acquires-studiopress\">WP Engine acquired StudioPress</a>. Brian Gardner, founder of StudioPress, recently <a href=\"https://authentik.com/sell/\">shared his thoughts</a> on why he didn&#8217;t want to sell the business, but did. </p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Making a decision that not only affects your livelihood, the livelihood of your partners and employees, and the livelihood of an entire community isn’t for the faint of heart.

In the past, WordSesh has been a marathon 24-hour event, but Richards decided to pare it down to 12 hours this year in order to organize the details quickly and get the next event on the calendar as soon as possible.</p>\n<h3>WordSesh Experiments with Charging Attendees for Tickets, Adds Real-Time Transcription</h3>\n<p>For the first time in WordSesh history, the event is charging attendees for tickets (rather than making it free for everyone as in years past). Richards is using the ticket money to pay speakers and have every video professionally transcribed in real-time. He has received some pushback on the decision but wants to see how things fare with this arrangement.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I thought the community might get behind that so we can stop asking speakers to completely volunteer their time, and the transcriptions are a huge accessibility bonus for non-native English speakers as well as the hard of hearing,&#8221; Richards said. &#8220;There have been just a few people pipe up to voice their distaste that I converted a free event to a paid event, which suggests there are many others stewing about it quietly, and I’m guessing it’s because they don’t realize where the money’s going (not that it should matter in either case).&#8221;</p>\n<p>Richards said tickets are dynamically priced to be the operational equivalent of $25 USD in every person&#8217;s home country. In India, for example, the ticket price is closer to $9 USD. He has kept quiet about the tech until now because he didn&#8217;t want people gaming the system but has since decided that it&#8217;s not a major concern.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The site accounts for purchase power parity so that the cost is not more than a couple of billable hours (or, ideally, much less) for everyone,&#8221; Richards said. &#8220;And for people whom the cost of a ticket is still a stretch, well, that’s where the scholarships come in.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordSesh still has 18 donated scholarships to give away but Richards said he is struggling to find people willing to apply to watch the event for free. Prospective attendees can <a href=\"https://wordsesh.com/product/wordsesh-scholarship/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">apply for a scholarship or nominate others to receive one</a>.</p>\n<p>A ticket to the event grants attendees access to the sessions, both live and after it has been recorded. Attendees will also receive virtual swag. A few samples include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A steep discount on WPSessions annual memberships (33%)</li>\n<li>Stripe is providing an exclusive link to skip the invitation process on their Atlas program and cover the cost for processing their first $5k of payments</li>\n<li>CorgiBytes is offering a $1k discount (~20%) on their code auditing services</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Previous WordSesh events averaged 1,000 online attendees and a good portion of them showed up the same day the events aired. This year there are approximately 400 registered so far. Richards said he won&#8217;t rule out the possibility of making the event free again for the next edition.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Asking more from sponsors could make a free event possible again without paying for everything personally (right now I&#8217;m still about $1000 in the red), but I really want to put the onus on the community at large,&#8221; Richard said. &#8220;Quality events take a lot of time and effort to accomplish, and most of that cost is on the backs of the organizers, speakers, and sponsors rather than attendees (at least in the WP community). Having been in all of those seats I&#8217;d really like to see more responsibility shift to the attendees. I would personally be happy to pay more for an event and be glad knowing that both speakers and organizers weren&#8217;t burning all this time in hopes of a return.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Virtual conferences have started gaining more traction in the global WordPress community after the success of previous WordSesh events. WordPress educator Zac Gordon recently hosted more than 1,000 attendees at his free <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/free-javascript-for-wordpress-conference-to-stream-live-friday-june-29\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">JavaScript for WordPress conference</a> in June. The Polyglots&#8217; virtual <a href=\"https://wptranslationday.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Global WordPress Translation day</a> has also attracted hundreds of participants at each event (448 attendees in April 2016, 780 attendees in November 2016, and 1,300 local event RSVPs in September 2017).</p>\n<p>Virtual events often reach far more people than an average local WordCamp, and many also inspire in-person meetups. Watch parties for WordSesh&#8217;s 5th edition are happening in cities across the globe, including Antwerp, Lagos, Minneapolis, Mumbai, and Bar Harbor (Maine).</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’ve always enjoyed seeing people pour in to the event each year, and there was a delightful hum throughout the WordPress community every time a WordSesh took place,&#8221; Richards said.</p>\n<p>WordSesh has been a valuable addition to the virtual event space around WordPress, and attendee numbers at the upcoming event will be important for measuring how much traction the event can retain with its conversion to a paid event. Richards says he is committed to keeping the event alive and hopes to host it two times per year, which is one of the reasons for cutting it back to 12 hours.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’m already excited for the next event,&#8221; Richards said. &#8220;I’m a little concerned at the moment, only because I don’t expect this one will sell enough tickets to break even, but I’m absolutely committed to hosting WordSesh again in the future. I’m more interested in hosting an incredible event and providing a ton of value to attendees than I am in breaking even this time around.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 23 Jul 2018 17:41:19 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg 3.3 Released, Adds Archives and Recent Comments Blocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=82478\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:84:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-3-3-released-adds-archives-and-recent-comments-blocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1354:\"<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/\"></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/\">Gutenberg 3.3</a> is available and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/07/20/whats-new-in-gutenberg-20th-july/\">continues the trend</a> of refining the user experience, user interface, and tools.

Karachi is the largest city in Pakistan with a population of more than 30 million people. Its airport connects the country to other international cities and smaller cities within Pakistan are available by rail or bus. Organizers behind the camp are overcoming a rocky history that has plagued the planning of WordPress-related events in the country for the past several years.</p>\n<p>At the close of 2015, Pakistan was on track to host its first WordCamp in Lahore, building on momentum from the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-community-growing-in-pakistan-500-attend-lahore-meetup\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">phenomenal growth of the local meetup group</a>. <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/xpertone\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Muhammad Kashif</a>, one of the organizers, was averaging 200-500 attendees at meetups and his team&#8217;s application to host <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-pakistan-application-approved-for-2016\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamp Lahore was approved for 2016</a>.</p>\n<p>The meetup events, which attracted young students, developers, freelancers, and entrepreneurs, had grown so large that Kashif was having to close registration ahead of time because they were exceeding the capacity of the venue. Organizers expected 400-500 attendees at the WordCamp before it was cancelled after several delays near the end of the planning stage.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/lahore-pakistan-wordpress-meetup-featured.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>After contacting the WordPress Community team for the reason why it was cancelled, I received an official response from representative Hugh Lashbrooke:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Sometimes a WordCamp doesn’t make it all the way from pre-planning to being an actual event — occasionally due to logistical challenges, but other times because of broader concerns. In this case, once the WordCamp planning was underway, some tense dynamics arose within the local team. Everyone worked really hard to reach a positive solution, but we weren’t able to move forward with the event in the end.</p>\n<p>Cancelling an event is never anyone’s preference, to be clear, but it is also a customary response when it’s clear that collaboration isn’t possible in the short term. Local organizers are always encouraged to reapply as soon as the barriers to collaboration have been resolved.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Lashbrooke also cited issues with the camp&#8217;s budget for the venue organizers selected. He said the situation was thoroughly investigated before the camp was cancelled and that they would never take that kind of decision lightly.</p>\n<p>WordCamp Lahore organizers gave me a different report on what happened and were disappointed with the decision from the Community Team.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Representatives from the Foundation cancelled the camp in the last stage based on a complaint from one person out of a community of 3,000 people,&#8221; Kashif said. &#8220;The Foundation made a direct decision of cancellation without giving me a chance for explanation as the Primary Organizer. I suggested the Foundation conduct a survey from the whole Lahore community to know the facts but they had already made the decision to cancel.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Kashif claims there was no disagreement between the organizers, because the community member in question, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/mrahmadawais\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ahmad Awais</a>, was never part of the original organizing team.</p>\n<p>One member of the planning team agreed to speak to me anonymously about why he believes the camp was canceled. He claims that Awais fractured the team after his request to be given a prominent position in the organization was denied.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Ahmad Awais started hijacking Kashif and his team,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He was not a lead organizer at all, but on the planning team. Instead of contributing, Ahmad wanted to speak at every meetup and didn’t spend time with organizing team. He broke the team and started pointing fingers at Kashif and the existing organizing team. He was NOT there until WC Lahore was approved. He joined the team after that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Multiple leaders from WordCamp Karachi&#8217;s 14-person organizing team, who wish to remain anonymous, have reported that Awais also requested to be named keynote speaker and was unhappy with the team after they told him that speaker decisions do not work like that. Several said they feared his retaliation against the camp, given they previously had no recourse with the Community Team after the experience of WordCamp Lahore getting shut down.</p>\n<p>Awais is not attending WordCamp Karachi and has declined to answer any questions about WordCamp Lahore due to personal reasons.</p>\n<p>Kashif received hundreds of messages from the community after the event in Lahore was cancelled. He had been working since 2013 to bring a WordCamp to the area. He said that while the Community Team was helpful with other queries he had, he was disappointed with how quickly the camp was cancelled.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I worked tirelessly for years to get a WordCamp to Lahore and grew the community from 430 to 2600 in one year but the Foundation didn’t even give me a chance to explain before canceling WC Lahore, Kashif said. &#8220;I am a bit disheartened by that action.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Kashif is now helping with other WordCamps, including Karachi and NYC. He is also willing to work to re-establish a WordCamp Lahore in the future.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Like me there are lots of other WordPress enthusiasts in Pakistan who want to participate in WordCamps but not everyone can do that outside of Pakistan due to financial or visa reasons,&#8221; Kashif said. &#8220;I was accepted as a volunteer in WordCamp Europe but couldn’t join due to visa issues. I have seen so much excitement for WordCamp Karachi in the WordPress community across the whole country. Everyone is willing to help to make it a successful event so that there are more frequent WordCamps in Pakistan. The first one is so important as it will set expectations of outcomes of a WordCamp for people who are new to these events.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>WordCamp Karachi Organizers Aim to Make a Positive Impact on Pakistan</h3>\n<p>WordCamp Karachi organizers are attempting to move past the Pakistani WordPress community&#8217;s checkered history of contention. They are also eager to distance themselves from the conflict that took down WordCamp Lahore.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/usmankhalid/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Usman Khalid</a>, lead organizer of the camp, said he has put in a lot of effort asking organizers and volunteers to work together, regardless of the credit they will receive, and focus on the community.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I want to spend time on having a positive impact for this country, avoiding any kind of noise,&#8221; Khalid said. &#8220;The Pakistani WordPress community is vibrant in many ways. We have around 6,000 plus WordPressers in our community, with people who are selling their products and services worldwide.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Khalid said there are many users in Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad, Peshawer, and Faisalabad who are doing well with WordPress but are not yet connected to the community or participating in meetups and events. People from all over Pakistan will be attending the event as their first exposure to the WordPress community. Sessions will mostly be conducted in English but a few will be mixed with Urdu, the regional language.</p>\n<p>Khalid has experienced many growing pains in bringing the event to a community that is new to understanding how WordCamps work. In a country that is <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/pakistan-is-blocking-sites-hosted-on-wordpress-com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">notorious for its censorship</a>, WordPress&#8217; mission of democratizing publishing has the potential to change many lives.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Since this is first Wordcamp, many people even don&#8217;t know about it,&#8221; Khalid said. &#8220;Those who know want to be a speaker, or any lead role that can promote them. When we tell them it doesn&#8217;t work like this, they are mostly get annoyed.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tech publications around Pakistan have not been exposed to WordCamps either. Khalid said several of them have asked for money in order to cover the story of the event, unaware that the purpose of the camps and meetups is not to translate everything into business but to give back to the community.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I am simply working to actually deliver first and prove that this community can create a positive impact,&#8221; Khalid said. &#8220;I am sure after Wordcamp Karachi, the entire community within Pakistan will flourish, regardless of what happened in Lahore.&#8221; He said he hopes the next camps will be even more interesting in the future and that WordCamp Karachi will help to create new jobs and more businesses in Pakistan.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 20 Jul 2018 23:14:27 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";O:42:\"Requests_Utility_CaseInsensitiveDictionary\":1:{s:7:\"\0*\0data\";a:8:{s:6:\"server\";s:5:\"nginx\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Fri, 17 Aug 2018 03:12:11 GMT\";s:12:\"content-type\";s:8:\"text/xml\";s:4:\"vary\";s:15:\"Accept-Encoding\";s:13:\"last-modified\";s:29:\"Fri, 17 Aug 2018 03:00:29 GMT\";s:15:\"x-frame-options\";s:10:\"SAMEORIGIN\";s:4:\"x-nc\";s:9:\"HIT ord 2\";s:16:\"content-encoding\";s:4:\"gzip\";}}s:5:\"build\";s:14:\"20180816132009\";}","no"),
